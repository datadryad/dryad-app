## Dataset publication

Once your submission has been reviewed and approved by our team of curators, you will receive a notification of publication via email, your dataset will be made publicly available, and the Dryad DOI will be registered.

If the Data Publishing Charge is not covered by a journal or your institution, if you have not already paid for your submission, or if you are not eligible for a fee waiver, an invoice will be generated and sent upon publication. If you require assistance with paying the invoice or readdressing an invoice, please respond directly to the invoice email.

### Software publication with Zenodo

Dryad formed a partnership with [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a multidisciplinary repository based at CERN, in 2019. [This partnership](https://blog.datadryad.org/2019/07/17/funded-partnership-brings-dryad-and-zenodo-closer/) leverages each organization's strengths: data curation at Dryad and software publication at Zenodo.

Through our integration, any software uploaded during the data submission process will be published at Zenodo. The software will not go through Dryad curation processes, but it will be time-released with the publication of the Dryad dataset. Both the data and software packages will be linked and denoted on the Dryad landing page under “Related works”.

### Deletion

Data published at Dryad is intended to remain permanently archived and available. Removal of a published dataset is considered an exceptional action akin to article retraction and should be requested and fully justified by the original contributor (e.g., if there are concerns over privacy or data ownership). To request the retraction of data from Dryad, contact our helpdesk.


## Citing your dataset

As soon as you start a data submission, a DOI is reserved for that dataset in the format `https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.XXXX`. This, and a full citation in a standard format, is included in the Citation section of a published dataset. If you need the DOI before you submit your dataset, for instance to include in a manuscript submission, you can find it on your Dryad Dashboard. The DOI provided will remain unchanged through publication of the dataset.


## Updating your dataset

You can update your data by clicking on the "Revise submission" link for your dataset in your [Dryad dashboard](/dashboard). Any edits made will build upon the last submitted version of the dataset; the DOI will remain the same. Once the latest version has been approved by our curation team and published, only the most recent version of your dataset will be packaged and available for download via the "Download dataset" button. If the dataset is versioned, prior versions can be accessed via the "Data files" section which is organized by the date of publication.

Newly created versions will not incur a [Data Publishing Charge (DPC)](/help/requirements/costs) unless the DPC for the file size of the new version exceeds the DPC already paid, in which case the difference will be charged.
