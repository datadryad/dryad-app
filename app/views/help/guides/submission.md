<h1>Submitting data</h1>

Before you begin a submission, please ensure your submission meets [our requirements](/help/requirements/files) and follows [good data practices](/best_practices). 


## Preparing your data

Data publishing includes describing and organizing your data in a way that makes it accessible and reusable. We recommend the use of [good data practices](/help/guides/best_practices), including descriptive names for file names and table headings, and a logical file organization.

Assemble all data files together. Where possible, data should be shared in [an open file format](/help/requirements/files#preferred-file-formats) so that proprietary software is not required to view or use the files.

* All files should be able to be opened without any passcode restrictions.
* All information needs to be in English.
* No Personal Health Information or sensitive data can be included. See <a href="/docs/HumanSubjectsData.pdf">tips for human subjects data <span class="pdfIcon" role="img" aria-label=" (PDF)"/></a> and <a href="/docs/EndangeredSpeciesData.pdf">tips for sensitive species data<span class="pdfIcon" role="img" aria-label=" (PDF)"/></a>.
* Files must not contain any copyright restrictions.


## Timing your submission

Data may be submitted and published at any time. However, if your data is associated with a journal publication, there may be special considerations:

* If you received an invitation from a journal to submit data to Dryad, then that journal has integrated its submission process with Dryad. Please follow the instructions from the journal.
* Dryad usually does not grant short- or long-term embargoes of data, but we will consider requests in specific instances (i.e., graduate students publishing thesis data that they intend to use for other parts of their thesis/dissertation; media blackouts around a study). If you wish to embargo data beyond the publication date of the associated article, we require confirmation from the publishing journal. Please submit an embargo request to <a class="emailr" href="mailto:dev@null?subject=Embargo+request&body=My+Dryad+dataset+DOI:%0D%0AEmbargo+reason:" aria-label="Email Dryad help desk">gro.dayrdatad@pleh</a> at the time of submission.
* Regardless of journal, you may choose to make your data temporarily [Private for Peer Review](#private-for-peer-review).


## Create your submission

An average submission follows this process:

<ol id="infographic">
  <li>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-arrow-up-from-bracket" aria-hidden="true"></i>Initial submission</h3>
    <p>Upload your data, complete metadata fields, and prepare a README file. Complete the checklist and carefully review the dataset before you pay and submit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-eye-slash" aria-hidden="true"></i>Private for Peer Review option</h3>
    <p>If your dataset is associated with a manuscript under review, you can choose to keep the dataset private and use a temporary sharing link for peer review. The dataset can proceed to curation once the manuscript has been accepted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group" aria-hidden="true"></i>Curation</h3>
    <p>Our experienced data curators will thoroughly evaluate each dataset to ensure the completeness of metadata, documentation, and files, following <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FAIR principles<ExitIcon /></a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-arrow-rotate-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>Revisions</h3>
    <p>Revise your dataset based on curator feedback.<br />Don&apos;t hesitate to contact us with questions!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-database" aria-hidden="true"></i>Publication</h3>
    <p>After final review, our curators will approve and publish your dataset. Your DOI will become active, and your dataset will be searchable, citable, and reusable.</p>
