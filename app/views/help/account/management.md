<h1>Managing my account</h1>

From the Dryad [My account](/account) page, users can update their names, email addresses, and Dryad partner institutions, or create IDs and tokens to use the [Dryad API](/api).

## Account information

The first name (any given names) and last name (surname/family name) from your account will be automatically included as an author with your ORCID in your Dryad submissions.

The email address entered will be used for any communications from Dryad if there are issues or notifications regarding your submissions. It may need to be an institutional email address if you are affiliated with and wish to receive sponsorship from some of our institutional partners. 

If you change your Dryad account email address, you will be asked to verify that you can receive mail at the new address entered. You will be sent an email verification code at the new email address.

### Dryad partner affiliations

[Dryad partner institutions](/about#our-partners) sponsor the [Data Publishing Charge](/help/requirements/costs) for their affiliated authors. You can change or add a new affiliation from your account page.

On the [My account](/account) page, click <span role="emphasis" class="o-button__plain-text7" disabled="" style="color: #00527A"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: .25ch"></i>Add a Dryad partner institution</span> to add a new institution, or <span role="emphasis" class="o-button__plain-text7" disabled="" style="color: #00527A"><i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: .25ch"></i>Edit affiliation</span> to remove or change your affiliated partner institution. Select your institution from the list, and click <span role="emphasis" class="t-login__buttonlink" disabled="" style="background-color: white; padding: 5px 15px">Login to verify</span> to complete your institution's verification process.

## API accounts

The [Dryad API](/api) can be used to search, access, and download Dryad datasets. With a Dryad API account, users can make increased requests to the Dryad API at 4 times the rate of anonymous API users. The API is also an alternative way to create and modify Dryad dataset submissions.

To create an API account, visit your Dryad [My account](/account) page, and click <span role="emphasis" class="o-button__plain-textlink" disabled="" style="color: #00527A"><i class="fas fa-user-gear" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: .25ch"></i>Create a Dryad API account</span>. 

You will be provided with an API account ID and secret, and an initial API token with which to [use the Dryad API](https://github.com/datadryad/dryad-app/blob/main/documentation/apis/api_accounts.md). Tokens expire every 10 hours.
