<h1>Creating a Dryad account</h1>

Dryad accounts allow users to create dataset submissions for publication on Dryad, for reuse, citation, and linking with journal publications and other research outputs. Creating a Dryad account requires an individual ORCID and email address.

## ORCID

Dryad requires an [ORCID](https://orcid.org) for login. ORCIDs are free, unique, persistant identifiers for individuals engaging in research, scholarship, and innovation. An ORCID uniquely identifies you as yourself and allows you to identify and claim your research outputs and other contributions, reducing confusion between individuals with similar names, and assigning appropriate credit. Journals, preprint servers, and other repositories for research outputs identify individuals with ORCIDs.

Dryad uses ORCID so that we can authenticate and identify each individual researcher, regardless of your route of entry to Dryad (i.e. through the website, through the API, through a journal integration, etc.). When datasets are published, they can appear in your ORCID profile along with articles and other works.

If you do not yet have an ORCID, you will have the opportunity to create one.

### Multiple ORCIDs and Dryad accounts

ORCIDs are meant to be unique per individual. If you have multiple ORCIDs, log into the one ORCID account you wish to retain, and [remove any duplicate ORCIDs](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006896634-I-have-more-than-one-ORCID-iD).

If you have multiple Dryad accounts due to having multiple ORCIDs, after having your duplicate ORCIDs removed, please [contact our help desk](/help/contact) to have your Dryad accounts merged.

## Institutional sponsorship

Dryad has publishing and institutional partners that sponsor the [cost of publishing data](/help/requirements/costs) for authors. Our institutional partners require their sponsored authors to authenticate with their systems or through a valid institutional email address. This can be done during account creation, and institutional partner sponsorship can be changed at any time from the [My account](/account) page.

## Account creation steps

1. Visit the [Dryad login page](/sessions/choose_login)
2. Click <span role="emphasis" class="t-login__buttonlink" disabled="" style="background-color: white;"><i class="fab fa-orcid" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size: 1.8rem"></i> Login or create your ORCID iD</span>
3. You will be redirected to the ORCID login screen, as pictured: <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/orcid_login.png" alt="Sign in to ORCID. Don't have your ORCID iD yet? Register now. Email or ORCID iD (For example: joe@institution.edu or 0000-1234-5678-9101). Password. Sign in to ORCID. Forgot your password or ORCID ID?" style="width: 300px; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/></p>
4. Log into ORCID by entering your ORCID account information and password. If you do not yet have an ORCID, click "<span style="color: #085c77;font-size: .98rem;">Register now</span>" and go through the steps. Save your ORCID, which can uniquely identify you in journal publications and other research outputs.</li>
5. Once you have created or logged into your ORCID account, you will be automatically logged into Dryad and directed to "Choose a partner", as pictured:<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/choose_partner.png" alt="Choose a partner. ORCID login successful. Is your institution a Dryad partner? Partner institutions cover the fees for their researchers to use Dryad. Select your Dryad partner institution. Login to verify" style="width: 400px; display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/></p>
6. If you are associated with a Dryad partner institution, select your institution from the list, and click <span role="emphasis" class="t-login__buttonlink" disabled="" style="background-color: white; padding: 5px 15px">Login to verify</span> to complete your institution's verification process. If you are not sponsored by an institution, click <span role="emphasis" class="t-login__buttonlink" disabled="" style="background-color: white;">Continue to email verification</span>
7. The final step of creating a Dryad account is entering and verifying your email address. You will be sent an email verification code at the email address you enter. If you do not receive an email verification code, please contact the helpdesk.
