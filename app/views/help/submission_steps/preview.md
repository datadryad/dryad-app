<h1>Preview and payment</h1>

On the **Agreements** screen of the Dryad submission editor, you will be informed of the costs associated with your dataset or notified of any sponsorship you are eligible for. You will also be asked to agree to the Dryad [terms of submission](/terms). Once you have agreed to the terms, you may preview your submission.


## Submission preview

The submission preview lays out all the information entered and files uploaded, similarly to the way the data submission will appear when made publicly available on Dryad. Each section remains editable by the submission’s [collaborators](/help/submission_steps/authors#collaborating-on-a-data-submission). You may edit any section and immediately see your changes reflected in the preview.

The dataset submitter may review and submit the data, either for curation and publication, or for [Private for Peer Review](/help/submission_steps/peer_review) status. If the dataset is not sponsored by one of Dryad’s partners, the submitter will need to complete payment in order to submit.


## Payment 

If the submitter is affiliated with a partner institution, or the related primary publication is associated with a sponsoring journal title, the sponsor of the [Data Publishing Charge](/help/requirements/costs) (DPC) will be indicated on the submission preview.

Otherwise, the submitter will be asked to pay the DPC upon submission. Payment is completed through Stripe, which allows different payment methods depending on your country and other factors.

If you have chosen for the dataset to be Private for Peer Review, you may decide to pay a Private for Peer Review fee, with the full DPC due when the dataset is ready for curation and publication. If you require an invoice to be sent to another entity for payment, an additional administration fee will be charged.

If your submission should be sponsored, but you do not see a statement indicating as much, please contact the helpdesk.
