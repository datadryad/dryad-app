<h1>Connecting publications</h1>

If your submission is linked to other publications, such as articles, preprints, or other datasets, listing those publications in Dryad connects your data to those works. These connections can be seen on the published dataset landing page, and in the metadata that can be retrieved using your data DOI.

There are two steps in the submission checklist for entering related works information. Primary works, for which your data is foundational, should be entered at **Connect**, the first step of a submission, in order to receive sponsorship or import data from these works. Other related works should be entered at a later step of the checklist, **Related works**.

## Sponsorship

If your submission contains the foundational data for a primary article or manuscript submission to one of our sponsoring [partner journals](/journals), that journal will sponsor the [Data Publishing Charge](/costs). Follow the steps on the **Connect** screen and enter the DOI for your article, or select the journal and enter the manuscript number for your submitted manuscript, to connect your publication and receive sponsorship.


## Importing metadata

Required metadata information for your submission, including the title, author list, abstract, subjects, and funders, can be imported from preprints and published articles with a DOI, or from submitted manuscripts for some [partner journals](/journals). 

In order to import metadata from one of these works, follow the steps on the **Connect** screen to enter the DOI or other required information for the work. Then, proceed to the **Title** screen, choose your entered source, and click ‘Import metadata’. 


## Related works

Related publications of many types can be connected to your data from the **Related works** screen of the submission checklist. For each publication, you will need a DOI or other URL. Connections can be made to works of the following types:

* Article
* Dataset
* Preprint
* Software
* Supplemental information
* Data management plan
