<h1>Private for Peer Review</h1>

After curation, Dryad submissions are made publicly available. If curation should be delayed because you have an associated manuscript undergoing peer review, we offer the option to keep files Private for Peer Review on the **Agreements** screen of the Dryad submission editor.

After selecting this option, you will be emailed a private URL that allows for a double-anonymous download of the dataset. This link can be used by the journal office or reviewers to access the data files during the review period. 

<div class="callout warn"><p><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation" aria-hidden="true"></i>
The Reviewer sharing link is a temporary sharing URL that provides privileged access to your uncurated data. It is not a permanent identifier, and should be substituted with the dataset DOI at the point of final manuscript submission or the page proofs stage.
</p></div> 

The DOI reserved for your dataset is a permanent identifier and will not change at any point after the dataset has been created. The DOI will activate upon publication of the dataset.

Submissions left in Private for Peer Review for one year with no activity will be automatically withdrawn.


## Release for curation

When your manuscript has been accepted, you can take your dataset out of Private for Peer Review and submit it for curation and publication. To do this, log in to Dryad and navigate to "My datasets". Find the submission under the "Kept private" heading. On the right, click the "Release for curation" button, and confirm.

Note that if your manuscript is submitted to and accepted by an integrated journal that sends us status updates on your manuscript, the Private for Peer Review period will automatically end. If your data is otherwise associated with a published primary article, the Private for Peer Review period will automatically end.
