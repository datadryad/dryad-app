# Origins

Dryad was first conceived in a series of meetings in 2007, hosted alternately by the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) in California (USA) and [National Evolutionary Synthesis Center](https://nescent.org/) (NESCent) in North Carolina (USA). Our first platform for curating and openly publishing a wide breadth of data types, such as those associated with research in ecology and evolutionary biology, was launched in 2008 with support from a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

The project was originally named DRIADE: The Digital Repository of Information and Data for Evolution – which was coincidentally also the name of a [favorite local cafe](https://caffedriade.com/). By the time the platform launched, the name had evolved to “Dryad,” which is easier to remember – frankly – and evokes positive associations with trees. It was important not to hard-code evolution research into what would become home for a wide-ranging scope of data but, with the shorter name, the founders did “coyly allude to phylogenies”.[^1]   

In the life of Dryad, outlined below, the introduction of the [Joint Data Archiving Policy](https://datadryad.org/docs/JointDataArchivingPolicy.pdf) (JDAP) by a pioneering group of journals and scientific societies in 2011 is worth singling out. JDAP states, to start, that committing journals will require: 


<blockquote>as a condition for publication, that data supporting the results in the paper should be archived in an appropriate public archive [...]. Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future.</blockquote>

The release of this statement was deeply formative in Dryad’s development and reflects a pioneering spirit that continues to drive us today.
