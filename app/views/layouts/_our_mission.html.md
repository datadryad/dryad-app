# What we do

Dryad advances our vision – for the open availability and routine reuse of research data to drive the acceleration of discovery and translation of research into benefits for society – by enabling the open publication and routine reuse of all research data. 

**We make it easier to share, find, use and cite data, and are ready-made for emerging data-sharing requirements.**



* Data curation at Dryad – Ensures data is appropriate and licensed for sharing; Verifies data is accessible and usable; and Supports authors.
* Data publishing at Dryad – Ensures metadata quality; Increases discoverability of data; Connects data with other research outputs; Promotes data citation; and Makes data count.
* The Dryad platform – Offers a smooth and easy publishing experience for authors; Integrates readily with publisher workflows; Runs on open-source software; May be accessed via open API.

Dryad serves all research domains and welcomes submissions of data in every field – where there is not an existing specialist repository and where the data may be shared openly. Dryad publishes data exclusively under a [Creative Commons Public Domain License](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (CC0) and does not support the publication of sensitive data, to which access should be restricted.

Our [custom process](/stash/process) is dedicated exclusively to research data. We work in concert with [aligned organizations](/stash/collaborations) to facilitate the release and interconnection of related software, supplementary information, research articles, preprints, data management plans and more.
