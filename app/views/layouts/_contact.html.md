## Request changes

Have you noticed a problem with Dryad, or a feature we’re missing? Anyone may request changes to Dryad, from the smallest wording change to major new features. All requests will be evaluated and prioritized for potential inclusion into the Dryad system.

Please send feature requests to <a class="emailr" href="mailto:dev@null?subject=Feature request">gro.dayrdatad@pleh</a>, with “Feature request” in the subject line. As part of the request, please answer as many of the following questions as possible:

 - Who would use the feature?
 - What problem are you trying to solve for these users?
 - What would change about Dryad if the feature is successful?
