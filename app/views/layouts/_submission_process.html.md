<h1>Submission and Publication Process</h1>

<p>
    Data publishing includes describing and organizing your data in a way that makes it accessible and reusable to
    researchers. For an overview see our <a href="/docs/QuickstartGuideToDataSharing.pdf">Quick Start to Data Sharing</a>.
    Dryad’s process is outlined here, including links to our <a href="/stash/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> with
    information on particular topics and <a href="/stash/best_practices">recommendations for good data practices</a>. If
    you need further assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@datadryad.org">help@datadryad.org</a>.
</p>

<p>Ready to get started? <a href="/stash/">Log in</a> and go to "My Datasets" to begin your data submission now!</p>

<h2 id="login">Login</h3>

<p>
    Dryad requires an <a href="https://orcid.org">ORCID ID</a> for login. If you do not have an ORCID, you will have the
    opportunity to create a free, unique, identifier for yourself at the login page. Dryad uses ORCID so that we can
    authenticate and identify each individual researcher regardless of your route of entry to Dryad (i.e. through the
    website, through the API, through a journal integration, etc.). When datasets are published, they should appear in
    your ORCID profile along with articles and other works.
</p>

<p>
    For institutional members, we require a second form of authentication at login for campus single-sign-on. After you
    have logged in with your institutional credentials, Dryad ties together your ORCID and institutional affiliation so
    that you will not have to include this information a second time.
</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, within "My Datasets" you can begin your submission.</p>

<h2 id="uploading">Uploading your data</h3>
<p>
    You will first be asked to enter metadata (information about your data). Check out our tips for complete and
    <a href="/stash/faq#metadata">comprehensive metadata</a>.  When you <a href="/stash/faq#upload-files">upload data files</a>,
    ensure that they meet our <a href="/stash/faq#files">file requirements</a> and are able to be opened, they do not
    contain sensitive information, and do not have licensing conflicts with <a href="/stash/faq#cc0">CC0</a>. Please
    upload a <a href="https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme">README</a> that describes your data as a .txt file.
</p>

<p>
    If you choose to upload Software which will be triaged and published at Zenodo, we recommend uploading a README specific
    to the software on page three. For more information about our Zenodo integration check
    out <a href="/stash/faq#zenodo-integrate">our FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You will have the opportunity for data to be curated and published immediately or if you prefer for data to be private
    during your peer review process, select <a href="/stash/faq#ppr">Private for Peer Review</a> on the “Review and Submit”
    page.
</p>

<h2 id="curation">Dataset Curation</h3>
<p>
    We will review your data ensuring it meets our <a href="/stash/faq#curation">curation requirements</a>. If we have
    questions we’ll get in touch with you. For more information check out <a href="/stash/faq">our FAQ</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="publication">Dataset Publication</h3>
<p>
    Once your dataset has been approved by our curators it will be published and publicly available. We will notify you
    by email and this email will contain a permanent DOI that can be used to <a href="/stash/faq#cite">cite your dataset</a>.
    If the cost of your dataset is not covered by a journal, your institution, or a country waiver you will
    <a href="/stash/faq#cost">receive an invoice</a>. Datasets can be versioned at any time by clicking <a href="/stash/faq#update">&quot;update&quot;</a> on
    your dataset.
