# Collaborations

Academic and research institutions, research funders, scholarly societies and publishers invest in Dryad for the curation, open sharing and reuse of research data in all fields. See our [member list](/stash/our_membership) and [how to join us](/stash/join_us).

Dryad advocates for community-adopted standards for metadata and persistent identifiers in concert with DataCite, ORCID, ROR, and Funder Registry. 

We support the recommendations and implementation guidance of the [Joint FORCE11 & COPE Research Data Publishing Ethics Working Group](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293) and the [Joint Declaration on Data Citation Principles](https://force11.org/info/joint-declaration-of-data-citation-principles-final/).
