# What we do

Dryad advances our vision – for the open availability and routine reuse of research data to drive the acceleration of discovery and translation of research into benefits for society – by enabling the open publication and routine reuse of all research data. 

**We make it easier to share, find, use, and cite data, and are ready-made for emerging data-sharing requirements.**

* Data curation at Dryad – Ensures metadata quality; verifies data are accessible, usable, and licensed for sharing, and supports authors.
* Data publishing at Dryad – Increases discoverability of data, connects data with other research outputs, promotes data citation, and makes data count.
* The Dryad platform – Offers a smooth and easy publishing experience for authors, integrates readily with publisher workflows, runs on open-source software, and may be accessed via open API.

Dryad serves all research domains and welcomes submissions of data in every field – where there is not an existing specialist repository and where the data may be shared openly. Dryad publishes data exclusively under a [Creative Commons Public Domain License](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) (CC0) and does not support the publication of sensitive data to which access should be restricted.

Our process is dedicated exclusively to research data. We work in concert with [aligned organizations](/stash/about#collaborations) to facilitate the release and interconnection of related software, supplementary information, research articles, preprints, data management plans, and more.

## Researcher benefits

We make it easy and affordable for researchers to curate, publish, and preserve research data by providing robust infrastructure, services, and expertise to meet your needs for public release of data, as well as for fulfilling funder mandates.

We are a nonprofit organization and exist to promote an environment where research data are openly available, managed, preserved, integrated with publications, and routinely reused to create knowledge. We operate on a cost-recovery—*not* profit-maximizing—basis.

When you publish your data with Dryad, you join a community of researchers committed to leading in best practices for open data publishing. 

## Our curation and publication process

Since 2007, Dryad has been a leader in curating and openly publishing research data across domains. For the community of academic and research institutions, research funders, scholarly societies, publishers, and individual researchers that invest in Dryad, our service offers expertise, capacity, accountability, and quality.

At Dryad, curation is the process of thoroughly evaluating research metadata and related objects to verify that data are accessible, organized, intelligible, and complete to ensure ease of re-use. Curators work with researchers to confirm that data are appropriate for open sharing, follow FAIR principles, and meet ethical standards for publication. They also offer guidance on best practices for creating reusable data and help authors navigate publication requirements.

Dryad Curators assess submissions carefully and raise questions for investigation/escalation when there are concerns about the reusability, provenance, interoperability, or comprehensibility of the data submitted for publication in Dryad. We do not attempt to assess rigor or veracity.

Data publishing is the presentation of openly available and citable research data that is optimized to promote discoverability, connected to enhance visibility, and protected to guarantee the long-term preservation of quality research data.

Data curation and publishing ensure equitable access to data and create opportunities to foster new collaborations and connections across the research community, helping Dryad to achieve our vision for the acceleration of discovery and translation of research into benefits for society.
