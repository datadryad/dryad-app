  <p>Joining the Dryad community has helped us build stronger connections with researchers on campus, engage more fully in discussions related to the management and sharing of research data, and become part of the broader open science community. Being able to address the question “How can I share my data?” with a top of the line and curation-focused platform not only helps us to address an immediate need but allows us to position the library as a source of expertise on related issues more generally. Our partnership with Dryad allows Lane Medical Library to offer exceptional data storage and curation so we can focus our resources on education, guidance, and community building.</p>

  <p>Dryad provides a simple solution for data sharing and compliance with emerging funder policies that is already recognised and supported by communities of authors, reviewers and editors. Partnering with Dryad over many years has been vital in realizing our data sharing policy: with hundreds of datasets being openly available in support of research integrity and openness.</p>
