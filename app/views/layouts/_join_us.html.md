<blockquote>
  <p>Joining the Dryad community has helped us build stronger connections with researchers on campus, engage more fully in discussions related to the management and sharing of research data, and become part of the broader open science community. Being able to address the question “How can I share my data?” with a top of the line and curation-focused platform not only helps us to address an immediate need but allows us to position the library as a source of expertise on related issues more generally. Our partnership with Dryad allows Lane Medical Library to offer exceptional data storage and curation so we can focus our resources on education, guidance, and community building.</p>
