<em>Joining the Dryad community has helped us build stronger connections with
researchers on campus, engage more fully in discussions related to the
management and sharing of research data, and become part of the broader open
science community. Being able to address the question “How can I share my data?”
with a top of the line and curation-focused platform not only helps us to
address an immediate need but allows us to position the library as a source of
expertise on related issues more generally. Our partnership with Dryad allows
Lane Medical Library offer exceptional data storage and curation so we can focus
our resources on education, guidance, and community building.</em>

<h2 id="consortia">Consortia Membership</h2>

<p>
A Dryad Consortium is a group of three or more organizations that have come together to collectively participate in Dryad’s membership program and use Dryad’s services and resources within their consortium. The benefits of a Dryad Consortium allow like-minded organizations to share knowledge and pool resources to increase the uptake of Dryad services.
</p>
<p>
A Dryad Consortium designates a single organization within the consortium that is the Consortium Lead and serves as the main contact point for Dryad communication and billing. The Consortium Lead works with the Dryad team and helps implement the adoption of Dryad within their consortium. The Dryad Consortium can distribute costs and align activities across their Consortium Organizations to align with their own policies and practices.
</p>

<h3 id="consortia-fee">Consortia Member Fee Structure</h3>
<p>
All member levels include the benefits listed for Institutional Members. The level selected should reflect your consortia’s anticipated research output. In the first year of membership, there is an additional setup fee of $200 per institution. Please select the level that you believe is the best fit for your consortia.  We are happy to discuss this decision with you.
</p>
<p>
Consortia costs align with our Institutional Membership fee structure and are based on the anticipated research output of each institution, with a 20% discount then applied.
For example, if a consortium consists of three Level I institutes and two Level II institutes, the cost would be 3 x $3000 ($9000 for the Level I institutions), 2 x $7500 ($15,000 for the Level II institutions) for a sum of $24,000 with then a 20% discount applied, for a total consortia member fee of $19,200.
