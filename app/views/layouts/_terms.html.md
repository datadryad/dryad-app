These Dryad Terms of Submission and Use (these “Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions of Submission to and Use of Dryad, a nonprofit corporation under the laws of North Carolina, USA, and Use of Dryad Infrastructure and Services. These Terms apply with equal force to individuals and organizations using Dryad Infrastructure and Services.

## Background

Dryad is a not-for-profit membership organization that makes it easy and affordable to curate, preserve, Publish, and reuse Research Data; and to meet your organization’s needs for the public release of data and fulfilling funder mandates. Our vision is that the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. To that end, Dryad:

 - enhances research by making data openly available and reusable;
 - enables Datasets to be widely indexed and discoverable;
 - assigns and registers Identifiers that point to or give context to Datasets on the Dryad Website;
 - tracks the usage of Datasets, and promotes data citation and reuse as a metric of scholarly credit;
 - makes data both accessible today and preserved for use in the future;
 - respects and protects the privacy of its users; and
 - generally, meets the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy data curation and publication service.

All of the above functions and offerings, including associated systems, hardware, software, and know-how, are referred to in these Terms of Membership (these “Terms”)  as the “Dryad Infrastructure and Services.”

When you Publish your Research Data within Dryad, you join a community of researchers and organizations committed to leading in best practices for open data curation and publishing. 

If you would like your institution to join Dryad, please direct your administrators to our [Join us page](stash/join_us) and encourage them to contact our Head of Partnership Development with any questions at <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="mailto:dev@null" class="emailr">gro.dayrdatad@olleh</a></span>.
