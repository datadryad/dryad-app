<h1>Data Publishing Charges</h1>

<p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides long-term access to its contents at no cost to users. We are able to provide free access to data due to financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad's Data Publishing Charges (DPCs) are designed to recover the core costs of curating and preserving data.</p>
<p><strong>Waivers</strong> are granted upon request (<a href=mailto:help@datadryad.org>help@datadryad.org</a>) for submissions originating from researchers based in countries <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups">classified by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The base DPC per data submission is $120</strong>. DPCs are invoiced upon curator approval/publication, unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>the submitter is based at a member institution (determined by login credentials), or</li>
<li>an associated journal or publisher has an agreement with Dryad to sponsor the DPC, or</li>
<li>the submitter is based in a fee-waiver country (see above).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overage-fees">Overage fees</h2>
<p>For submissions without a sponsor or waiver, Dryad charges excess storage fees for data totaling over 50GB. For data packages in excess of 50GB, submitters will be charged $50 for each additional 10GB, or part thereof. (Submissions between 50 and 60GB = $50, between 60 and 70GB = $100, and so on).</p>
