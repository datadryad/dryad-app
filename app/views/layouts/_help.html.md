## Submission Basics
We have some general reminders and suggestions for publishing your data with Dash:

- We accept all file formats, although it is good practice to share data using open formats. See the [UK Data Archive](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table) for a list of optimal file formats
- Any data submitted will be under the [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or CC0 license. We do not currently support any other license types, nor do we allow for restrictions on data access or use
- It is your responsibility to ensure your data are being shared responsibly and ethically. Please be careful of sharing sensitive data and ensure you are complying with institutional and governmental regulations
- When preparing your complete version of a dataset, remember to collate all relevant explantory documents and metadata. This includes relevant documentation necessary for the re-use and replication of your dataset (e.g., readme.txt files, formal metadata records, or other critical information, etc.)


## Metadata
Comprehensive data documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key to future understanding of data. Without a thorough description of the context of the data file, the context in which the data were collected, the measurements that were made, and the quality of the data, it is unlikely that the data can be easily discovered, understood, or effectively used. Metadata is important not only to help people understand and make proper use of a data resource, but metadata also makes the resource discoverable (for example through internet searches or data indexing services). Read more about metadata in the [DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

A complete list of our default metadata fields is below. Additional metadata can be uploaded alongside the dataset (e.g., as a readme.txt file). Our default metadata entry form is based on fields from the metadata schema of the DOI issuing agency, DataCite.

Required Fields:

- Title : Title of the dataset. Make sure to be as descriptive as possible
- Author(s): Name, email address, institutional affliation of main researcher(s) involved in producing the data.  If you include your [ORCID](http://orcid.org), we will request the ORCID registry auto-populate this publication on your ORCID profile
- Abstract: Short description of dataset

Optional Fields (the more you describe your dataset, the wider the reach):

- Keyword(s) : Descriptive words that may help others discover your dataset. We recommend that you determine whether your discipline has an existing controlled vocabulary from which to choose your keywords. Please enter as many keywords as applicable
- Methods : Any technical or methodological information that may help others to understand how the data were generated (i.e. equipment/tools/reagents used, or procedures followed)
- Usage Notes : Any technical or methodological information that may help others determine how the data may be properly re-used, replicated, or re-analyzed
- Funding Information : Name of the funding organization that supported creation of the resource, including applicable grant number(s)
- Related Works : Use this field to indicate other resources that are associated with the data. Examples include publications, other datasets, code etc.
-  Location information : Include the geo-coordinates or name of the location where your data were generated or the location that is the focus of your research

## Upload Methods
We have two different options for uploading your data. 
- Upload directly from your computer: by using drag and drop or the upload button. We allow for 10gb of data per DOI to be uploaded this way. 
- Upload from a server or the cloud: by entering the URL of the location where data are held on a server, or the sharing link for Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive. We allow for 100gb of data per DOI to be validated and uploaded this way.

Please note that you may only use one of these two upload methods per version, but you may do subsequent versions of your data publication and utilize different methods of upload this way.

## Publication and Citation
- We do allow for you to delay the publication of your data if for the purposes of having a related article under peer review. If you do choose to utilize this feature we allow for up to a maximum of 180 days to delay publication. 
- As soon as your data publication is public we recommend citing and publicizing your work with your given DOI. 
- If you have edits, additional data, or subsequent related work we recommend versioning your data by using the "update" link. All versions of a dataset will be accessible and kept in the Merritt Repository, but the dataset DOI will always resolve to the newest version.
