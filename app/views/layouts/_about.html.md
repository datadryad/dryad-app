# About Dryad

## Our Mission<a name="mission"></a>

The Dryad Digital Repository is a curated resource that makes research data **discoverable, freely reusable, and citable**. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of data types.

Dryad originated from an initiative among a group of leading journals and scientific societies to adopt a joint data archiving policy (JDAP) for their publications, and the recognition that **open, easy-to-use, not-for-profit, community-governed data infrastructure** was needed to support such a policy. These remain our guiding principles.

Dryad’s vision is to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.

Our mission is to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.

### Key features
- Flexible about data format, while encouraging the use and further development of research community standards.
- Fits into the manuscript submission workflow of its partner journals, making data submission easy.
- Assigns Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to data so that researchers can gain professional credit through data citation.
- Promotes data visibility through usage and download metrics and by allowing content to be indexed, searched and retrieved. 
- Promotes data quality by employing professional curators to ensure the validity of the files and descriptive information.
- Contents are free to download and re-use under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.
- Contents are preserved for the long term, in partnership with the DataONE network and with Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) to guarantee access to contents indefinitely.
- Open source, standards-compliant technology.


## Our Community<a name="community"></a>

**Data are the foundation of the scientific enterprise**. By preserving and providing open access to research data, Dryad provides benefits to individual researchers, educators and students and to a diversity of stakeholder organizations including institutions, publishers, and funders.

## Our Platform<a name="platform"></a>

Dryad is an open source, community driven project that takes a unique approach to data publication and digital preservation. Dryad focuses on search, presentation, and discovery and delegates the responsibility for the data preservation function to the underlying repository with which it is integrated.

For information about submission to Dryad, see our [guidance here](/stash/help/#submission).


### Architecture and Implementation

Dryad is completely open source.  Our code is made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad). Dryad is based on an underlying Ruby-on-Rails data publication platform called Stash. Stash encompasses three main functional components: Store, Harvest, and Share.

- Store: The Store component is responsible for the selection of datasets; their description in terms of configurable metadata schemas, including specification of ORCID and Fundref identifiers for researcher and funder disambiguation; the assignment of DOIs for stable citation and retrieval; designation of an optional limited time embargo; and packaging and submission to the integrated repository
- Harvest: The Harvest component is responsible for retrieval of descriptive metadata from that repository for inclusion into a Solr search index
- Share: The Share component, based on GeoBlacklight, is responsible for the faceted search and browse interface

<a href="/dash_architecture_diagram.png"><img src="/dash_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Dash Architecture Diagram" style="width: 500px;"/></a>

Individual dataset landing pages are formatted as an online version of a data paper, presenting all appropriate descriptive and administrative metadata in a form that can be downloaded as an individual PDF file, or as part of the complete dataset download package, incorporating all data files for all versions.

To facilitate flexible configuration and future enhancement, all support for the various external service providers and
repository protocols are fully encapsulated into pluggable modules. Metadata modules are available for the DataCite and
Dublin Core metadata schemas. Protocol modules are available for the SWORD 2.0 deposit protocol and the OAI-PMH and
ResourceSync harvesting protocols. Authentication modules are available for InCommon/Shibboleth18 and Google/OAuth
identity providers (IdPs).

We welcome collaborations to develop additional modules for additional metadata schemas and repository protocols. Please email the Dryad <a href=mailto:help@datadryad.org>help desk</a> or visit GitHub (https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad) for more information.

### History

Dryad's original iteration launched in 2009 and was built upon the open-source DSpace repository software. In 2019, Dryad merged with Dash, a data publication service developed at the [University of California Curation Center](http://www.cdlib.org/uc3) (UC3), a program at [California Digital Library](http://www.cdlib.org) (CDL).

The Dash project began as [DataShare](http://datashare.ucsf.edu/), a collaboration among [UC3](http://www.cdlib.org/uc3), the [University of California San Francisco Library and Center for Knowledge Management](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/),
and the [UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute](http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/) (CTSI). CTSI is part of the Clinical and Translational Science Award program funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health. Dash version 2 developed by UC3 and partners with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation ([our funded proposal](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mw6v93b)).  Read more about the code, the project, and contributing to development on the [Dash GitHub site](http://cdluc3.github.io/dash)
