<h1>About Dryad</h1>

<h2>Our Mission<a name="mission"></a></h2>

<p>The Dryad Digital Repository is a curated resource that makes research data <strong>discoverable, freely reusable, and citable</strong>. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of data types.</p>
<p>Dryad originated from an initiative among a group of leading journals and scientific societies to adopt a joint data archiving policy (JDAP) for their publications, and the recognition that <strong>open, easy-to-use, not-for-profit, community-governed data infrastructure</strong> was needed to support such a policy. These remain our guiding principles.</p>
<p>Dryad’s vision is to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.</p>
<p>Our mission is to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.</p>

<h3>Key features</h3>

<h2>Our Platform<a name="platform"></a></h2>

Dryad is an open source, community driven project that takes a unique approach to data publication and digital preservation. Dryad focuses on search, presentation, and discovery and delegates the responsibility for the data preservation function to the underlying repository with which it is integrated.

For information about submission to Dryad, see our [guidance here](/stash/help/#submission).


<h3>Architecture and Implementation<a name="architecture"></a></h3>

<p>Dryad is completely open source.  Our code is made publicly available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad">https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad</a>). Dryad is based on an underlying Ruby-on-Rails data publication platform called Stash. Stash encompasses three main functional components: Store, Harvest, and Share.</p>

<ul>
<li>Store: The Store component is responsible for the selection of datasets; their description in terms of configurable metadata schemas, including specification of ORCID and Fundref identifiers for researcher and funder disambiguation; the assignment of DOIs for stable citation and retrieval; designation of an optional limited time embargo; and packaging and submission to the integrated repository</li>
<li>Harvest: The Harvest component is responsible for retrieval of descriptive metadata from that repository for inclusion into a Solr search index</li>
<li>Share: The Share component, based on GeoBlacklight, is responsible for the faceted search and browse interface</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/dash_architecture_diagram.png"><img src="/dash_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Dash Architecture Diagram" style="width: 500px;"/></a></p>

<p>Individual dataset landing pages are formatted as an online version of a data paper, presenting all appropriate descriptive and administrative metadata in a form that can be downloaded as an individual PDF file, or as part of the complete dataset download package, incorporating all data files for all versions.</p>

<p>To facilitate flexible configuration and future enhancement, all support for the various external service providers and
repository protocols are fully encapsulated into pluggable modules. Metadata modules are available for the DataCitemetadata schema. Protocol modules are available for the SWORD 2.0 deposit protocol and the OAI-PMH and
ResourceSync harvesting protocols. Authentication modules are available for InCommon/Shibboleth18 and ORCID
identity providers (IdPs).</p>

<p>We welcome collaborations to develop additional modules for additional metadata schemas and repository protocols. Please email the Dryad <a href=mailto:help@datadryad.org>help desk</a> or visit GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad">https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad</a>) for more information.</p>
