<h1>Journal Integration</h1>

Dryad works with authors and journals to integrate dataset submission as a part of an authorâ€™s manuscript submission process.
<p>

<h2 id="authors">Authors:</h2>
 
If your journal has a mailer-integration with Dryad (<a href="https://datadryad.org/docs/JournalLookup.pdf">journal integration list</a>), 
please enter your <strong>journal name</strong> and <strong>manuscript number</strong> at the first form field of your Dryad submission.  Without this information we cannot 
autocomplete information from your manuscript or time-release your submission with your manuscript acceptance. 

<h2 id="journals">Journals:</h2>

For our mailer-integration to work we ask that you please follow these instructions:
<ul>
<li>Remind authors in your communications that entering the journal name and manuscript number at the beginning of their Dryad submission is a requirement for the integration to work successfully
<li>Emails must be sent in plain text only, without HTML or images
<li>Structure email communications with the following <strong>six mandatory metadata fields</strong> [<a href="http://wiki.datadryad.org/Journal_Metadata">more information on metadata</a>]
<ul>
<li><strong>Journal Name</strong> - full publication name of the journal.
<li><strong>Journal Code</strong> -  abbreviation Dryad uses internally; specified during the integration process
<li><strong>MS Reference Number</strong> - corresponds to journal's internal manuscript number
<li><strong>MS Title</strong> - manuscript title
<li><strong>MS Authors</strong> - Authors; usually "Last, First" with authors separated by semicolons. 
<li><strong>Article Status</strong> - Status
<ul>
<li>Accepted
<li>Submitted
<li>Needs revision
<li>Rejected
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
If you have any questions about the submission process, or if your journal is interested in integrating with Dryad, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:help@datadryad.org">help@datadryad.org</a>.
