For planning and scientific review purposes Dryad stores records of usage. Dryad makes available to the public information regarding the aggregate usage of Datasets. Logs of usage may also be maintained for the purposes of monitoring and improving services, or measuring the impact of a particular function on Dryad resources. These logs may be made available, after anonymization, to third parties. 


## Information not considered personally identifiable

Dryad may automatically collect information not generally considered to be “personally identifiable” from Submitters and Users using Dryad Infrastructure and Services directly or indirectly, including:

## Personally provided information

Users who do not Submit Datasets to Dryad are not asked to provide any personally identifying information.

Dryad Infrastructure and Services will not store or record any Users credit card, debit card, bank account or any other form of payment account on its servers.

Submitters login to the Dryad Website using an ORCID identifier. In addition, if affiliated with a Member institution, submitters authenticate using a single sign-on process via Shibboleth. Personally identifiable information is used by Dryad to conduct and improve core services including billing and responding to help requests. Dryad may contact Submitters with information or questions directly related to their use of Dryad Infrastructure and Services.

Dryad Members and the Dryad Infrastructure and Services may send automated notices to each other as part of Submission Integration. These communications may convey personally identifiable information regarding authors and Submitters that will be accessed by Dryad solely as required to provide services.

Dryad will only disclose individually identifiable personal information under the following restricted circumstances:

* it has been included within a Dataset by the Submitter or publisher;
* it is required by law enforcement or by statute, or to protect Dryad’s or others’ legal rights, property, or safety;
* disclosure is required to resolve disputed Submissions or otherwise carry out the obligations of these Terms;
* disclosure to trusted third parties is required for assistance in maintaining the Dryad Infrastructure and Services, provided that those parties agree to keep such information confidential.

If Submitters and Users choose to provide Dryad with additional personally identifiable information through an email message, form, survey, or other means, Dryad will maintain the information securely to the extent allowable by law and use commercially reasonable efforts to protect it. However, Dryad will treat feedback on Dryad Infrastructure and Services, excluding personally identifiable information, as non-confidential unless the Submitter or User providing the feedback states otherwise.
