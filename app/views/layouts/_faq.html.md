## Who can publish data via Dash?

This site is targeted for use by members of the University of California and DataONE communities. Researchers in any field from participating UC campuses (with exception, see Davis below) can use their campus credentials to deposit data in their campus-specific website. Anyone in the world can search, view, and download datasets. The following nine institutions currently participate in publishing data in Dash:

- [UC Berkeley](https://dash.berkeley.edu/)
- [UC Irvine](https://dash.lib.uci.edu/)
- [UC Merced](https://dash.ucmerced.edu/)
- [UC Office of the President](https://dash.ucop.edu/)
- [UC Riverside](https://dash.ucr.edu/)
- [UC Santa Cruz](https://dash.library.ucsc.edu/)
- [UC San Francisco](https://datashare.ucsf.edu/)
- DataONE ONEShare (https://oneshare.cdlib.org/)

## What type of data is within scope?

All types of research data. However, this service is
intended for complete, re-usable, open research datasets and all content must not violate
privacy or copyright, or breach confidentiality or nondisclosure for data
collected from human subjects.

## What are the size limits?

There is a limit of 100gb per data publication. All data files are
stored and preserved in the Merritt Repository. More information about the Merritt
Repository Service is available in the white paper
"[UC3, Merritt and Long-term Preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf)."

## Does the data have to be associated with a publication?

No. We encourage and accept all quality data, regardless of whether they have been
used to publish a paper to be deposited, shared, and preserved.


## How are the datasets discoverable?

All datasets will be indexed by the
[Thomson-Reuters Data Citation Index](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/about/)
and [Scopus](http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus). Furthermore, each dataset
is given a unique Digital Object Identifier or DOI. Entering the
DOI URL in any browser will take the user to the dataset's landing page in
Merritt. This service also provides a faceted search and browse capability for
direct discovery.

## Who can access and use datasets in Dash?

Every dataset landing page includes usage information associated with the
dataset. Data may be associated with any of the following licensing
terms:

1. Custom Data Use Agreement.
2. [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   (CC-BY-4.0). According to the terms of the CC-BY license, reuse of the
   data must include appropriate credit and must indicate if changes were
   made.
3. [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication Waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
   (CC0). This waiver has no restrictions on use and encourages reuse of
   data for any and all purposes.

All new data intended for ONEshare must be submitted under the terms of
the CC0 waiver; data intended for any of the UC campus instances must be
submitted under the terms of the CC-BY license.

Note: data contributed before standardization to these two licensing
regimes retain their original licensing terms.

Although many researchers would prefer to maintain more control over who
downloads and uses their data, we believe that fully open data best
supports the advancement of knowledge. Read the
[Panton Principles for Open Data in Science](http://pantonprinciples.org/)
for more information.


## What feature do you offer to make my dataset have the broadest reach?

Comprehensive documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key for dicoverability as well as ensuring future researchers understand the data. Without thorough metadata (description of the context of the data file, the context in which
the data were collected, the measurements that were made, and the quality
of the data), the data cannot be found through internet searches or data
indexing services, understood by fellow researchers, or effectively used. 

We require a few key pieces of metadata. Additional information can be
included in the “Usage Notes” section of the description, or as a separate
readme.txt file archived alongside the dataset files. The metadata entry
form is based on fields from the
[DataCite schema](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-3/index.html) and is broadly applicable to data from any field.


## For how long will the data be available?

Data deposited are permanently archived and available through the
[California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org/)'s
[Merritt Repository](https://merritt.cdlib.org/). For a full description
of the services provided by Merritt, see this document:
[UC3, Merritt, and Long-term preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf).

Preservation policy details include:

- **Retention period**: Items will be retained indefinitely, at the
  discretion of the participating campus library and/or UC3.
- **Functional preservation:** We make no promises of usability and
  understandability of deposited objects over time.
- **File preservation**: Data files are replicated with multiple copies in
  multiple geographic locations; metadata are backed up on a nightly
  basis.
- **Fixity and authenticity**: All data files are stored along with a
  SHA-256 checksum of the file content. Regular checks of files against
  their checksums are made. The audit process cycles continually, with a
  current cycle time of approximately two months.
- **Succession plans**: In case of closure of the repository, reasonable
  efforts will be made to integrate all content into suitable alternative
  institutional and/or subject based repositories. 

## Can I delete my data?

Data deposited is intended to remain permanently archived and
available. Deletion of a deposited dataset is considered an exceptional
action which normally should be requested and fully justified by the
original contributor (e.g., if sensitive human subject data was not
properly de-identified). If your data must be deleted, contact
[uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu).
