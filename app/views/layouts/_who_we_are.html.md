# Who we are

<p>Dryad is an open data publishing platform and a community committed to the open availability and routine re-use of all research data.</p>
<p>Our vision is for a future in which the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. We advance our vision through our mission: to enable the open publication and routine reuse of all research data.</p>
<p><a href="/stash/join_us#our-membership">Our multi-stakeholder community</a> of academic and research institutions, research funders, scholarly societies and publishers is committed to leading in best practices for open data sharing and reuse. They invest in Dryad for the curation, open sharing and reuse of research data in all fields.</p> 

<p>We value responsibility, inclusion, openness and trustworthiness:
  <ul>
    <li>We are mindful that our decisions can impact the health of the research community and the environment and we assume responsibility for considering the implications of our actions in advance.
    <li>We strive to overcome barriers to participation by individuals and organizations within the global research community.
    <li>We invest in open practices in research and in our organization to promote integrity, trust, collaboration and progress.
    <li>Our obligation as a trusted partner to research is to ensure that the interests of the research community remain our focus, that data are available to evidence new research, that data published with us persist, and that our organization and service are sustainable and available to support research so long as we are valued. Dryad is a signatory to the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a> (POSI).
  </ul>
</p>
<p>In all of our convenings we are committed to abiding by our <a href="/stash/code_of_conduct">Code of conduct</a>.</p>

## Collaborations

Academic and research institutions, research funders, scholarly societies and publishers invest in Dryad for the curation, open sharing and reuse of research data in all fields. See our [member list](/stash/our_membership) and [how to join us](/stash/join_us).

Dryad advocates for community-adopted standards for metadata and persistent identifiers in concert with DataCite, ORCID, ROR, and Funder Registry. 

We support the recommendations and implementation guidance of the [Joint FORCE11 & COPE Research Data Publishing Ethics Working Group](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293) and the [Joint Declaration on Data Citation Principles](https://force11.org/info/joint-declaration-of-data-citation-principles-final/). 

We are also pleased to partner with the following organizations and initiatives, for:

* **Journal workflow integration**: [Editorial Manager](https://www.ariessys.com/solutions/editorial-manager/), [eJournalPress](https://www.ejournalpress.com/)
* **Persistent identifiers for data publications:** [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)
* **Standardized usage metrics for data:** [Make Data Count](https://makedatacount.org/)
* **Data submission enhancements**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (Concurrent submission of software and supplemental information); [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) (Tabular data quality validation); [rSpace](https://www.researchspace.com/) (Electronic lab notebook integration) 
* **Presenting research data alongside associated research articles**: [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) ([National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/)), [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/)
* **Community engagement and standards development**: [Data Curation Network](https://datacurationnetwork.org/), [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/), [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)
* **Data publishing and generalist repository alignment:** [National Institutes of Health Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/news/nih-office-of-data-science-strategy-announces-new-initiative-to-improve-data-access) (GREI)
* **Metadata enhancement**: [Metadata Game Changers](https://metadatagamechangers.com/), [CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/)

This list is a work-in-progress. If you’d like to suggest an addition, please [contact us](/stash/contact). 

Dryad is supported by a partnership with California Digital Library (CDL), whose in-kind investment in product management, platform development, the preservation repository behind Dryad (Merritt), and grants management is made in the context of an ongoing and formal collaboration that was initiated in 2018. ([Learn more](https://blog.datadryad.org/2018/05/30/dryad-partnering-with-cdl-to-accelerate-data-publishing/)) 

Our most current grants and funding initiatives are listed in our [Annual report](https://github.com/datadryad/governance/tree/main/annual-reports).

## Origins

Dryad was first conceived in a series of meetings in 2007, hosted alternately by the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) in California (USA) and [National Evolutionary Synthesis Center](https://nescent.org/) (NESCent) in North Carolina (USA). Our first platform for curating and openly publishing a wide breadth of data types, such as those associated with research in ecology and evolutionary biology, was launched in 2008 with support from a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

The project was originally named DRIADE: The Digital Repository of Information and Data for Evolution – which was coincidentally also the name of a [favorite local cafe](https://caffedriade.com/). By the time the platform launched, the name had evolved to “Dryad,” which is easier to remember – frankly – and evokes positive associations with trees. It was important not to hard-code evolution research into what would become home for a wide-ranging scope of data but, with the shorter name, the founders did “coyly allude to phylogenies”.<sup><a title="Quoting Todd Vision, Dryad Principal Investigator from 2007, in email communication with Executive Director Jennifer Gibson - July 6, 2022">1</a></sup>

In the life of Dryad, outlined below, the introduction of the [Joint Data Archiving Policy](https://datadryad.org/docs/JointDataArchivingPolicy.pdf) (JDAP) by a pioneering group of journals and scientific societies in 2011 is worth singling out. JDAP states, to start, that committing journals will require: 


<blockquote><p>as a condition for publication, that data supporting the results in the paper should be archived in an appropriate public archive [...]. Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future.</p></blockquote>

The release of this statement was deeply formative in Dryad’s development and reflects a pioneering spirit that continues to drive us today.
