# Code of Conduct

*Updated: July 13, 2020*

We value the participation of each member of the Dryad community. Accordingly, all community members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members in Dryad spaces.

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Dryad community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, participants and volunteers in any Dryad virtual or in-person space are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct Working Group will enforce this code in alignment with our reporting guidelines and procedures

We enjoy partnering with other groups and know that our projects are all stronger when we work together. Therefore, this is not an exhaustive list of things that we can’t do. Rather, please take these guidelines in the spirit in which they’re intended &#8211; a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Dryad, which include Slack, Github, events, meetings, and other forums created by Dryad that are used for communication. This Code of Conduct also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the organization or its community. Examples of representing the organization or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person&#8217;s ability to participate within them.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Be friendly and positive. </strong>Discussions and collaborations are easier and more successful when 
    they happen among positive and open-minded people who share knowledge generously and look to learn from others’ 
    experience and perspective.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be welcoming and supportive 
    to people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, 
    culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual 
    orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and 
    physical ability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the 
    work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into 
    account when making decisions. Remember that Dryad projects affect a diverse and worldwide community, so you might 
    not be communicating in someone else&#8217;s primary language.</li><li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of 
    us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. We might all experience some 
    frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to 
    remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the 
    Dryad team and our partners should be respectful when dealing with each other as well as with people outside the 
    community.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of professionals, 
    and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. 
    Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren&#8217;t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited 
    to:<br/><br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
      <li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
      <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
      <li>
        Posting (or threatening to post) other people&#8217;s personally identifying information (&#8220;
        doxing&#8221;)
      </li>
      <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
      <li>
        Unwelcome sexual attention</li><li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above 
        behavior
      </li>
      <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>When we disagree, listen</strong>,   Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time 
    and we are no exception. It is important that we listen to each other and work to resolve disagreements 
    constructively.
  </li>
</ul>

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.

## Dryad Code of Conduct &#8211; Reporting Guide

Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. For online spaces, this is the Code of Conduct Working Group. For in-person events, there will be clearly identified Code of Conduct incident responders. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being asked to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing the Code of Conduct Working Group at <a class="emailr" href="mailto:dev@null">gro.dayrdatad@tcudnoc</a>.

## Dryad Code of Conduct Working Group

<em>The composition of this group rotates &amp; will be updated here. Last updated 2022-09-15</em>

<ul>
  <li>Jennifer Gibson &#8211; <a class="emailr" href="mailto:dev@null">gro.dayrdatad@nosbigj</a></p></li>
  <li>Jason Williams &#8211; <a class="emailr" href="mailto:dev@null">ude.lhsc@smailliw</a></p></li>
</ul>

<strong>All reports will be kept confidential.</strong> In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that&#8217;s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.


<strong>If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate responders first.</strong> If you are unsure what types of responders are appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)</li><li>Names (real, 
    nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to 
    include them as well.</li><li>When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.</li><li>Your 
    account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC 
    logger) please include a link.</li><li>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</li><li>If you 
    believe this incident is ongoing.</li><li>Any other information you believe we should have.
  </li>
</ul>

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the Dryad Code of Conduct working group acknowledging receipt. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will immediately review the incident and  work to determine:
<ul>
  <li>What happened.</li>
  <li>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.</li>
  <li>Who the bad actor was.</li>
  <li>Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone&#8217;s physical safety.</li>
</ul>

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working group’s immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an &#8220;official&#8221; response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:
<ul>
  <li>Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
  <li>
    A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, a working group member will 
    deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc&#8217;ing the committee.</li><li>A public reprimand. 
    In this case, a committee member will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e.
    in IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The committee may choose to publish this message 
    elsewhere for posterity.</li><li>An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to &#8220;take a week off&#8221; from a 
    mailing list or IRC). A committee member will communicate this temporary ban&#8221;vacation&#8221; to the individual
    (s). They&#8217;ll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don&#8217;t agree then a temporary ban 
    may be imposed to enforce this vacation.</li><li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Dryad spaces 
    (mailing lists, meetings, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed 
    in the future or otherwise maintained.</li><li>A request for a public or private apology. A committee member will 
    deliver this request and provide mediation where appropriate.
  </li>
</ul>

We&#8217;ll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we&#8217;ve determined our final action, we&#8217;ll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we&#8217;ll be taking. We&#8217;ll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don&#8217;t guarantee we&#8217;ll act on it.

Finally, the working group will make a report on the situation to the Dryad leadership. The leadership may choose to make a public statement about the incident.

Dryad staff are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to Dryad’s staff policies. For contractors or vendors, violation of these guidelines may affect continuation or renewal of contract.

## What if your report concerns a possible violation by a working group member?

If your report concerns a current member of the Code of Conduct working group, you may not feel comfortable sending your report to the committee, as all members will see the report.

In that case, you can make a report directly to any of the individuals on the Code of Conduct working group. The individuals will follow the usual enforcement process with the other members, but will exclude the member(s) that the report concerns from any discussion or decision making.

## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary. If a report concerns a possible violation by a current committee member, this member should be excluded from the response process. For these cases, anyone can make a report directly to any of the committee chairs, as documented in the reporting guidelines.

## Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration of the committee’s decision. To make such a request, contact the Dryad Board with your request and motivation and the Dryad Board will review the case.
