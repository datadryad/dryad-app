<p>Dear <%= @user_name %>,</p>

<p>Thank you for your submission to Dryad titled, "<%= @resource.title %>".</p>

<p>
  Your data submission will soon be evaluated by a member of our curation team. Keep in mind that datasets are evaluated in the order they are received.
</p>

<p>Your dataset has been assigned two important links:</p>
<% shr = @resource.identifier.shares.first.sharing_link %>
<ul>
  <li>Reviewer URL: <a href="<%= shr %>"><%= shr %></a>.
    <p>This temporary link can be shared with the journal office or collaborators during the peer-review process to allow access only to the data files included with your submission. This link will expire upon publication of your Dryad dataset.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A unique digital object identifier (DOI): <%= @resource.identifier_str %>
    <p>When your dataset has been approved for publication by a member of our curation team, it will be made public. This DOI link is permanent and should be provided to the journal office for inclusion in the Data Availability statement of your published article.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<%if @resource.identifier.user_must_pay? %>
<p>You will receive an invoice via email upon publication of your dataset.</p>
