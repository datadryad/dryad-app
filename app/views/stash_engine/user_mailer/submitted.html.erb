<p>Dear <%= @user_name %>,</p>

<p>Thank you for submitting your dataset entitled, "<%= @resource.title %>".</p>

<p>
  Your submission will soon enter our curation process. Once your submission
  has been reviewed and approved by our curators, your dataset will be
  published, pending any questions or requests from our team and/or timed
  publication requirements dictated by the journal title associated with your
  submission.
</p>

<% shr = @resource.identifier.shares.first.sharing_link %>

<p>
  Your dataset has been assigned a unique digital object
  identifier (DOI): <%= @resource.identifier_str %><br/>
  If your dataset is associated with a manuscript submission, you may provide
  this DOI to the journal office. The link will only be active upon
  publication of your dataset and it will not change post-publication. For
  private access prior to publication, you may share your dataset using the
  unique URL: <a href="<%= shr %>"><%= shr %></a>.
</p>

<p>
  Please note, datasets are curated in the order they are received. Attempting to access or update your submission
  before it enters our curation process will reset its' position in the queue and potentially delay the curation
  and publication processes. If you need to edit your dataset before curation begins, be sure to select 'Submit'
  after you have reviewed and confirmed your most recent changes. Otherwise, exiting from editing mode will place
  your submission 'In Progress' and it will not re-enter the queue for curation. To check the status of your data
  submission, please contact <a href="mailto:<%= @helpdesk_email %>"><%= @helpdesk_email %></a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you were required to agree to payment on the final page of the submission
  form, you will receive an invoice via email upon publication.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for choosing Dryad to host your data. We appreciate your support. If
  you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:<%= @helpdesk_email %>"><%= @helpdesk_email %></a>.
