# Partner with us

_Quality data publishing. Unmatched user support._

Dryad makes curating, publishing, and preserving research data simple and affordable. As a non-profit open data publishing platform, we provide robust open-source infrastructure, knowledgeable guidance and dedicated support to researchers, and an easy-to-use interface that facilitates data preparation and sharing. Dryad publishes thousands of datasets each year, comprising millions of individual data files across all fields of research — all optimized for sharing and reuse. 

Institutions, publishing organizations, academic societies, and others partner with us to sponsor data curation, publication, and preservation for researchers at a reduced rate. Partnership also streamlines workflows through system integration and limits administrative tasks for individual authors. Partner fees are calculated and billed annually based on usage and the size of the organization.

## Benefits of partnership

Dryad’s partner community includes research institutions, funders, publishers, and academic societies — all committed to maximizing the impact of research and accelerating the pace of discovery. Organizations partner with us to sponsor the cost of Dryad services for their researchers at a reduced rate. Researchers enjoy access to Dryad data curation, publication and preservation services, with hands-on support from our experienced team.

Dryad is more than a repository; we’re a mission-driven non-profit organization operating a service for data publishing in the community interest. We help researchers to meet data-sharing best practices as well as funder and journal requirements with individualized support from submission through to publication. Our data curators review each dataset shared with us to ensure that it is reusable and thoroughly described with appropriate metadata according to [FAIR data standards](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). With Dryad, you can be sure policy requirements are fulfilled, and data will remain discoverable, accessible, and reusable in perpetuity.

Dryad partners enjoy:

* Time-saving support, training, and outreach — to researchers, colleagues and stakeholders
* Convenient annual billing
* Administrative dashboard — for dataset monitoring and reporting both before and after publication 
* Lower per-dataset fees

## Fees

As a community-driven non-profit organization, Dryad is committed to enabling the open availability and routine reuse of all research data. We strive to make high-quality data publishing affordable as well as easy. 

All our fees are set on a cost-recovery basis and designed to keep Dryad’s systems running strong, while putting our services within reach for as many researchers as possible. Dryad fees are developed by an advisory group representing publishing organizations of all kinds, scholarly societies, the libraries and research offices for academic institutions, and academic library consortia. 

Fees fall into two categories:

* All Dryad authors incur a **Data Publishing Charge (DPC)** based on the variable costs of curating, publishing, and preserving one dataset — that is, one package of metadata and data files related to a single course of investigation. Pricing is designed to scale with use, with discounts based on volume for Dryad partners. [DPCs may be paid directly by individual authors](/requirements#unsponsored-author-fees), or sponsored by an organization through partnership with Dryad.

* In addition to sponsoring DPCs for affiliated authors, partner organizations pay an **Annual Service Fee** that funds Dryad’s fixed costs for operations, administration, and infrastructure. The service fee is calculated on a sliding scale based on the organizations’ overall revenue or expenditure.

### Partner fees

Institutions, publishers, academic societies, and others partner with Dryad to make our services available to their affiliated researchers at a reduced rate. Dryad partners trust us to provide individualized support to authors, and to curate, publish, and preserve data in the most economical way. Partner fees are calculated and billed annually based on usage and the size of the organization.
