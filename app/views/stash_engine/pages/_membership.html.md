# Membership terms

*Updated: August 29, 2023*

These Dryad Terms of Membership (these “Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions of Membership in Dryad, a nonprofit corporation under the laws of North Carolina, USA.

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms on the [Definitions](/stash/definitions) page.


## Background

1. Dryad is a not-for-profit membership organization that makes it easy and affordable to curate, preserve, Publish, and reuse Research Data; and to meet your organization’s needs for the public release of data and fulfilling funder mandates. Our vision is that the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. To that end, Dryad:
    - enhances research by making data openly available and reusable;
    - enables Datasets to be widely indexed and discoverable;
    - assigns and registers Identifiers that point to or give context to Datasets on the Dryad Website;
    - tracks the usage of Datasets, and promotes data citation and reuse as a metric of scholarly credit;
    - makes data both accessible today and preserved for use in the future;
    - respects and protects the privacy of its users; and
    - generally, meets the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy data curation and publication service.

    All of the above functions and offerings, including associated systems, hardware, software, and know-how, are referred to in these Terms of Membership (these “Terms”)  as the “Dryad Infrastructure and Services.”

    When you join Dryad as a Member you join a community of organizations committed to leading in best practices for open data publishing. 

    Additional information on Membership can be found on our [Join us](/stash/join_us#benefits-of-membership) page.

        1. By the Member for convenience upon 30 days’ written notice to Dryad;
        2. By the Member for cause (1) in the event of Dryad’s material breach of these Terms, which breach remains uncured following 45 days’ notice from the Member to Dryad (or is by its nature incapable of cure) or (2) in the event Dryad provides notice of a material amendment to these Terms pursuant to the provisions of Section 17 hereof, and the Member provides notice to Dryad within 60 days of such notice of the Member’s objection to such an amendment and its intention to terminate; and
        3. By Dryad upon written notice to the Member, in accordance with the Dryad Governing Documents, including (1) a misrepresentation in the Member’s Membership Agreement; (d) legal sanctions or judgments against the Member or its home country; (3) fraudulent use of Identifiers or Datasets; (4) failure to pay Fees due; or (5) any other basis set forth in the Dryad Governing Documents.
    2. *Review of Termination of Membership*. Except where termination is on account of nonpayment of Fees, the Executive Committee of Dryad’s board shall review and ratify any Dryad decision to permanently terminate a Member’s Membership or any significant Membership benefit, within 10 days of such decision. As part of this review, the Member will have an opportunity to be heard under such reasonable procedures as the board may determine in its good faith. Dryad or Member may petition the Executive Committee to review and ratify any Dryad decision temporarily restricting the Member’s access to or use of the Dryad Infrastructure and Services for a limited period, and the Executive Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether to conduct such a review.
    3. *Effect of Termination of Membership*. An outgoing Member shall not be entitled to a refund of any Fees that have been paid or waiver of any Fees that have accrued, except that a Member will be entitled to a refund of any prepaid Fees representing the remaining portion of the then-current term of such Member’s Membership in the event of a termination for cause pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) above. Termination of Membership shall have no adverse effect on Dryad’s intellectual property rights. Following termination of its membership, an outgoing Member shall have no further obligation to deposit Datasets within Dryad, and Dryad shall have no further obligation to curate, Publish or assign and register Identifiers within the Dryad Infrastructure and Services. With respect to Datasets deposited and Identifiers registered prior to such termination: (i) Dryad shall have the right to keep, maintain, and use such Datasets and Identifiers within the Dryad Infrastructure and Services; and (ii) the obligations of the Member set forth in Section 2(d) of these Terms will survive.
11. **Enforcement**. Dryad shall take reasonable steps to enforce these Terms, provided that Dryad shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to any Dataset that is the subject of an intellectual property dispute, but reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or suspend access from, to or through such Dataset or to take any other action it deems appropriate.
12. **Governing Law**. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable governing body, without regard to conflicts of laws principles or the location of the parties. The parties agree that they will not identify any specific jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this agreement.
13. **Disputes**. 
    1. *Alternative Dispute Resolution*. The Member shall promptly notify Dryad of any claim, dispute or action, whether against other Members or Dryad, related to these Terms or any Datasets or Identifiers. Pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, a single arbitrator reasonably familiar with the data publishing, open infrastructure and internet industries shall settle all claims, disputes or actions of any kind arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms between Dryad and the Member. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    2. *Injunctive Relief*. Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no party shall be prevented from seeking injunctive relief in anticipation, but not in any way in limitation, of arbitration. The Member acknowledges that the unauthorized deposit or use of Datasets would cause irreparable harm to Dryad, the Dryad Infrastructure and Services, and/or other Members, that could not be compensated by monetary damages. The Member therefore agrees that Dryad may seek injunctive relief to remedy any actual or threatened unauthorized Submission or use of Datasets.
14. **Disclaimer**. The Dryad Infrastructure and Services is made available to Members and other Users on an “AS IS” basis. Except as set forth herein, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Dryad makes no representations or warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, (i) implied warranties of accuracy, quality, performance, compatibility, merchantability, and/or fitness for a particular purpose; (ii) that any such Dataset or other material is free from personally identifiable, sensitive, infringing, errors, illegal data or material, viruses or other harmful components; and (iii) that any such Dataset or other material not suffer loss, corruption, interruption or destruction.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY MEMBER TO DRYAD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.**
16. **Mutual Indemnification**. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach of this agreement or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the indemnifying party or its agents or employees.
17. **Taxes**. The Member is responsible for all sales and use taxes imposed, if any, with respect to the services rendered or products provided to the Member hereunder, other than taxes based upon or credited against Dryad’s income.
18. **Other terms**. 
    1. *Independent Contractors*. These Terms will not create or be deemed to create any agency, partnership, employment relationship, or joint venture between Dryad and any Member. The Member shall not have any right, power or authority to enter into any agreement on behalf of, or incur any obligation or liability of, or to otherwise bind, Dryad.

        4. *Headings*. The headings of these sections and subsections used in these Terms are included for convenience only and are not to be used in construing or interpreting these Terms.
        5. *Severability*. If an provision of these Terms (or any portion thereof) is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected thereby and will be binding upon the parties and will be enforceable, as though said invalid or unenforceable provision (or portion thereof) were not contained in these Terms.
