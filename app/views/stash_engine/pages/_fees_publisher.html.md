# Publisher and society partner fees

_Effective March 25, 2025_

Publishing organizations of all kinds, as well as academic societies, partner with Dryad to make our services available to their researchers at a reduced rate. They trust us to provide individualized support to authors, and to curate, publish, and preserve data in the most economical way.

Our publisher and society partners also benefit from:

* Technical Integration with journal submission and peer review management systems
* Training and support for journal staff, editors and authors
* Access to data ahead of publication for editors and reviewers through our Private for peer review feature
* Administrative dashboard — for dataset monitoring and reporting both before and after publication

The annual partner fee is calculated as a total of the anticipated [Data Publishing Charge (DPC)](#data-publication-charge) for the coming year, plus the [Annual Service Fee](#annual-service-fee). DPCs are adjusted to reflect actual usage at year-end.

Estimate your organization’s total fees using our fee calculator, or read on for a detailed fee schedule.

## Data Publishing Charge

The DPC is based on the variable costs of curating, publishing, and preserving one dataset — that is, one package of metadata and data files related to one course of investigation. Pricing is designed to scale with use, with discounts based on volume. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="table-wrapper" role="region" tabindex="0" style="margin: 0 auto">
  <table style="width: 100%;">

Datasets larger than 10GB are billed individually as follows. Publisher and society partners may opt to cover large data fees or assign them to the author.

## Annual Service Fee

Partners pay a flat Annual Service Fee to help cover Dryad’s fixed costs for service, infrastructure and operations. Our fixed expenses include: partner support, training, and outreach; operation, maintenance and development of the Dryad platform; financial and legal administration; and leadership, oversight, and strategy development. As a global virtual organization, Dryad does not operate a physical office. Consult our [annual reports](https://github.com/datadryad/governance/tree/main/annual-reports) for details on Dryad expenses.

Annual Service Fees for Dryad publisher and society partners are tiered according to total publishing revenue or expenses. This approach is modeled after CrossRef, and uses the same tiers (as of November 2024).

To promote transparency and equity among our partners Dryad does not offer individual discounts. However, to support growth and development, especially of new data-sharing programs, we offer tiered pricing for three-year agreements, as follows. Three-year agreements are exempt from annual inflationary increases.

## Total fees

The DPC and Annual Service Fee are combined to calculate the total annual fee, which can range from $1,000 to $98,250 depending on the volume of data publications and organization reported publishing expenditure or revenue.
