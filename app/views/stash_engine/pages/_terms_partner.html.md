<p id="term-desc">Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms on the <a href="/definitions">Definitions</a> page.</p>


## Background

Dryad is a non-profit organization that makes it easy and affordable to curate, preserve, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span>, and reuse <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Research Data</span>; and to meet your organization’s needs for the public release of data and fulfilling funder mandates. Our vision is that the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. To that end, Dryad:  
  * enhances research by making data openly available and reusable;
  * enables <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> to be widely indexed and discoverable;
  * assigns and registers <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> that point to or give context to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> on the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span>;
  * tracks the usage of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>, and promotes data citation and reuse as a metric of scholarly credit;
  * makes data both accessible today and preserved for use in the future;
  * respects and protects the privacy of its users; and
  * generally, meets the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy data curation and publication service.

    All of the above functions and offerings, including associated systems, hardware, software, and know-how, are referred to in these Terms as the “Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>.”

2. Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span> are invested in the reliable curation, publication and preservation of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Research Data</span>. Partners must meet the Terms established by Dryad, as amended. Together with the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span>, these Terms govern the relationship with Dryad.

3. By entering into a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span> (“Agreement”) with Dryad, the partner entity agrees to be bound by these Terms and, upon receipt of payment for the first <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fee</span>, the entity becomes a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> of Dryad.


## Terms

1. **Partner Rights**. Subject to these Terms and Dryad’s policies, as promulgated by Dryad’s board and staff and made available on the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span> from time to time, the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall be entitled to use the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> as set forth herein.

Thereafter, the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fee</span> is invoiced as at the beginning of each calendar year.

Payment must be made within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.

   3. *Fee Schedule*. Dryad reserves the right to adjust the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span>, as set forth in the [Fee Schedule](https://datadryad.org/join_us), annually. <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> will be calculated annually based on the actual metrics from the preceding calendar year, in accordance with the tiered structure set forth in the Fee Schedule. For each renewal period, the applicable fee tier will be determined by the prior year's actual data volume, publishing revenue, or other relevant metric, as specified in the Fee Schedule. Adjustments to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span>, if any, will be reflected in the invoice for the subsequent year.

4. **Intellectual Property Rights**.

    1. *Termination of Agreement*. The Agreement may be terminated:

       1. At the end of the then-current term by the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> for convenience, provided, that the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> gives at least ninety (90) days’ written notice to Dryad before the end of the then-current term;

       2. By the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> for cause (1) in the event of Dryad’s material breach of these Terms, which breach remains uncured following forty-five (45) days’ notice from the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> to Dryad (or is by its nature incapable of cure) or (2) in the event Dryad provides notice of a material amendment to these Terms pursuant to the provisions of Section 20 hereof, and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> provides notice to Dryad within sixty (60) days of such notice of the Partner’s objection to such an amendment and its intention to terminate; and

       3. By Dryad upon written notice to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>, in the event of: (1) a misrepresentation by <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> in the Agreement; (d) legal sanctions or judgments against the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> in the US or its home country; (3) fraudulent use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> by the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>; (4) the Partner’s failure to pay <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> due; or (5) any other material breach of the Agreement.

    2. *Review of Termination of Agreement by Dryad for Cause*. Except where termination is on account of nonpayment of Fees, the Executive Committee of Dryad’s board shall review and ratify any Dryad decision to permanently terminate the Agreement or any significant partner benefit, within ten (10) days of such decision. Dryad or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> may also petition the Executive Committee to review any Dryad decision temporarily restricting the Partner’s access to or use of the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> for a limited period, and the Executive Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether to conduct such a review. The Executive Committee decision in any such matter is final.

    3. *Effect of Termination of Agreement*. 

       1. An outgoing <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner<span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc"> shall not be entitled to a refund of any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> that have been paid or waiver of any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> that have accrued, except that a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> will be entitled to a refund of any prepaid <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> representing the remaining portion of the then-current term under the Agreement in the event of a termination for cause pursuant to Section 10(a)(ii) above. 

       2. Termination of the Agreement shall have no adverse effect on Dryad’s intellectual property rights. Following termination of the Agreement, an outgoing <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall have no further obligation to deposit <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> within Dryad, and Dryad shall have no further obligation to curate, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span> or assign and register <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> within the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>. 

       3. With respect to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> deposited and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> registered prior to such termination: (i) Dryad shall have the right to keep, maintain, and use such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> within the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>; and (ii) the obligations of the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> set forth in Section 2(d) of these Terms will survive. 

       4. Upon giving notice of its decision to terminate the Agreement pursuant to 10(a)(i) above, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the outgoing <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall not submit or deposit any new <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> with Dryad.

       5. With respect to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> in progress in the event of expiration or termination of the Agreement, the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> will be charged the applicable <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publication Fees</span> for the Dataset(s), and a pro-rated <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Fee</span> for the portion of the year until the Dataset(s) is/are <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Published</span>; payment of such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> is due within thirty (30) days of invoice.

    4. *Cancellation Fee*. If a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> receives a discount for a multi-year term and the Agreement is terminated early pursuant to Section 10(a) the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> must pay Dryad a cancellation fee in the amount equivalent to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Fee</span> pursuant to the Fee Schedule minus the discounted amount actually paid by the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner for</span> the year in which the termination occurs.

11. **Enforcement**. Dryad shall take reasonable steps to enforce these Terms, provided that Dryad shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> that is the subject of an intellectual property dispute, but reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or suspend access from, to or through such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or to take any other action it deems appropriate.

12. **Governing Law**. These Terms shall be interpreted, governed and enforced under the laws of North Carolina, USA, without regard to its conflict of law rules. All claims, disputes and actions of any kind arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be settled in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

13. **Disputes**.

    1. *Alternative Dispute Resolution*. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall promptly notify Dryad of any claim, dispute or action, whether against other partners or Dryad, related to these Terms or any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span>. Pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, a single arbitrator reasonably familiar with the data publishing, open infrastructure and internet industries shall settle all claims, disputes or actions of any kind arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms between Dryad and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    2. *Injunctive Relief*. Notwithstanding Section 13(a), no party shall be prevented from seeking injunctive relief in anticipation, but not in any way in limitation, of arbitration. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> acknowledges that the unauthorized deposit or use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> would cause irreparable harm to Dryad, the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>, and/or other <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span>, that could not be compensated by monetary damages. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> therefore agrees that Dryad may seek injunctive relief to remedy any actual or threatened unauthorized <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submission</span> or use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>.

14. **Disclaimer**. The Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> is made available to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span> and other <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Users</span> on an “AS IS” basis. Except as set forth herein, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Dryad makes no representations or warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, (i) implied warranties of accuracy, quality, performance, compatibility, merchantability, and/or fitness for a particular purpose; (ii) that any such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or other material is free from personally identifiable, sensitive, infringing, errors, illegal data or material, viruses or other harmful components; and (iii) that any such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or other material not suffer loss, corruption, interruption or destruction.

15. **Mutual Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY PARTNER TO DRYAD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.**

16. **Mutual Indemnification**. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach of this agreement or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the indemnifying party or its agents or employees.

17. **Taxes**. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> is responsible for all sales and use taxes imposed, if any, with respect to the services rendered or products provided to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> hereunder, other than taxes based upon or credited against Dryad’s income.

18. **Other terms**.

    1. *Independent Contractors*. These Terms will not create or be deemed to create any agency, partnership, employment relationship, or joint venture between Dryad and any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall not have any right, power or authority to enter into any agreement on behalf of, or incur any obligation or liability of, or to otherwise bind, Dryad.

    2. *No Third-Party Beneficiaries*. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, neither party intends that these Terms shall benefit, or create any right or cause of action in or on behalf of, any person or entity other than Dryad and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>.

    3. *No Assignment*. A partner may not assign, subcontract or sublicense the Terms without the prior written consent of Dryad, and any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void.

    4. *Notices*. Written notice under these Terms shall be given as follows:

       1. If to Dryad: by emailing director@datadryad.org addressing Ms. Jennifer Gibson, Executive Director.

       3. *Survival*. Sections (and the corresponding subsections, if any) 2(d), 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 23 and any other provisions that by their express terms or nature survive, and any rights to payment, shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.

       4. *Headings*. The headings of these sections and subsections used in these Terms are included for convenience only and are not to be used in construing or interpreting these Terms.

       5. *Severability*. If any provision of these Terms (or any portion thereof) is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected thereby and will be binding upon the parties and will be enforceable, as though said invalid or unenforceable provision (or portion thereof) were not contained in these Terms.

19. **Entire Agreement**. These Terms, together with the Agreement and any Addenda or other contract executed between Dryad and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>, constitute the entire agreement between Dryad and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements.
