# Partner Terms of Service

*Updated: September 16, 2025*

These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions applicable to entities who enter into a partnership agreement with Dryad, a non-profit corporation.

<p id="term-desc">Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms on the <a href="/definitions">Definitions</a> page.</p>


## Background

1. Dryad is a non-profit organization that makes it easy and affordable to curate, preserve, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span>, and reuse <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Research Data</span>; and to meet your organization’s needs for the public release of data and fulfilling funder mandates. Our vision is that the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. To that end, Dryad:  
  * enhances research by making data openly available and reusable;
  * enables <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> to be widely indexed and discoverable;
  * assigns and registers <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> that point to or give context to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> on the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span>;
  * tracks the usage of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>, and promotes data citation and reuse as a metric of scholarly credit;
  * makes data both accessible today and preserved for use in the future;
  * respects and protects the privacy of its users; and
  * generally, meets the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy data curation and publication service.

    All of the above functions and offerings, including associated systems, hardware, software, and know-how, are referred to in these Terms as the “Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>.”

2. Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span> are invested in the reliable curation, publication and preservation of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Research Data</span>. Partners must meet the Terms established by Dryad, as amended. Together with the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span>, these Terms govern the relationship with Dryad.

3. By entering into a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span> (“Agreement”) with Dryad, the partner entity agrees to be bound by these Terms and, upon receipt of payment for the first <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fee</span>, the entity becomes a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> of Dryad.


## Terms

1. **Partner Rights**. Subject to these Terms and Dryad’s policies, as promulgated by Dryad’s board and staff and made available on the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span> from time to time, the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall be entitled to use the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> as set forth herein.

2. **Partner Obligations, Representations and Warranties.**

   1. The Partner represents and warrants that it has the authority to enter into the Agreement (including, without limitation, these Terms), and to bind itself to the Terms herein.

   2. The Partner further represents and warrants that it has caused the Agreement to be executed by a duly authorized representative.

   3. The Partner is responsible for informing Dryad of any changes to its contact information in the Agreement.

   4. Partners may not <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submit</span> <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> on behalf of its affiliated researchers without the express permission and full knowledge of the author of the Dataset or a researcher collaborating with the author(s), including explicit agreement to the Dryad [End User Terms of Service](/terms).

3. **Fees**. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall pay Fees as calculated in the [Fee Schedule](/join_us). These Terms refer to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fees</span>, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charges</span>, and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Large Data Fees</span> collectively as “Fees”.

   1. *Annual Service Fee*. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> is responsible to pay an annual fee (the “<span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fee</span>”). The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fee</span> for the Partner’s first year of the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span> is invoiced as a prorated amount for the initial calendar year under the Agreement, to be paid in full. Thereafter, the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fee</span> is invoiced at the beginning of each calendar year. Payment must be made within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Service Fees</span> for years following the initial year may be prepaid for up to three (3) years.

   2. *Data Publishing Charge*. Dryad may charge partners a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charge</span> (collectively, “Data Publishing Charge”) to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span> <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> with Dryad, as more fully described in the [Fee Schedule](/join_us) from time to time. Payment must be made within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.

   3. *Large Data Fees*. Dryad may charge partners a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Large Data Fee</span> (collectively, “Large Data Fees”) to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span> large <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> with Dryad, as more fully described in the [Fee Schedule](/join_us) from time to time. Partners have the option to cover Large Data Fees for <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Sponsored</span> authors and will specify the file size limit (currently, up to 2TB) and budget for each calendar year. The applicable Large Data Fees will be adjusted annually for partners with three (3) year agreements. For partners with agreements of less than three (3) year durations, the applicable Large Data Fees will remain fixed and are not subject to adjustment. Large Data <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Sponsorship</span> will automatically halt when the Large Data Fee tier is exhausted by <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publications</span> for the applicable year. Partners may pay an additional <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Large Data Fee</span> upon exhaustion of the tier or may apply prepayments at any point during the calendar year.

   4. *Fee Schedule*. Dryad reserves the right to adjust the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> and invoicing procedures, as set forth in the [Fee Schedule](/join_us), annually. <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> will be calculated annually based on the actual metrics from the preceding calendar year (for the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charge</span> and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Large Data Fees</span>), in accordance with the tiered structure set forth in the Fee Schedule. For each renewal period, the applicable fee tier will be determined by the prior year's actual data volume, publishing revenue, or other relevant metric, as specified in the Fee Schedule. Adjustments to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span>, if any, of the invoiced amount will be reconciled and will be reflected in the invoice for the subsequent year.

   5. *Multi-year commitments*. Partners entering into a multi-year agreement with Dryad benefit from discounts according to the Fee Schedule. Partners entering into agreements that start before June 30 qualify for the discount associated with year 1 of the agreement. Partners entering into agreements that start after June 30 also receive the discount associated with year 1 of the agreement.

   6. *Billing Order*. In the event that the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submitter</span> is affiliated with more than one Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>, relevant Partners will be billed in the following order: Funder followed by Institution followed by Publishing organization.

   7. *Affiliated Researchers*. Affiliations of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submitters</span> are determined at the point of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> submission. Any Submitter on the author list for the Dataset may invoke their institutional affiliation with a Dryad partner and the associated sponsorship. Requests for affiliation changes must be made by September 30th of each year to be effective January 1st.

   8. *General Payment Terms*. The following payment terms apply to all partners:

       1. Partners shall pay the applicable <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charge</span> and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Large Data Fees> at the beginning of each calendar year.

       2. Partners may choose to automatically halt services when their maximum Data Publication Volume is reached.

       3. Where partners do not indicate that services should halt upon reaching the maximum Data Publication Volume, Dryad will publish an amount of Datasets up to ten percent (10%) of the Partner’s maximum Data Publication Volume before pausing services.

       4. At the beginning of the calendar year, partners are billed for Datasets Published in excess of their Data Publication Volume for the prior year, in addition to the current year’s Data Publishing Charge.

       5. Partners publishing fewer Datasets than are included in their Data Publication Volume or Large Data Fee may use the same Data Publishing Charge or Large Data Fee tier for a second subsequent year only.

4. **Scholarly Publications covered by the Partnership Agreement**. Titles may be appended or removed during the term of this Agreement, provided that thirty (30) days’ written notice is provided to Dryad, and a conﬁrmation of receipt from Dryad is obtained, thereby eliminating the necessity for amendments to this Agreement. To make changes to the list of Scholarly Publications in the Partnership Agreement, contact partnerships@datadryad.org.


5. **Library consortia**.

    1. *Responsibilities*. Consortia entering into a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span> on behalf of several institutions, in accordance with the [Fee Schedule](/join_us), are responsible for:

        1. Coordinating participation by consortium members in the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span>;

        2. Providing and maintaining, as required during the duration of the Agreement, accurate and up-to-date contact information for the representatives of participating institutions;

        3. Support onboarding of new consortium members, including coordinating training sessions and other presentations on Dryad’s behalf;

        4. Paying the fees set out in the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span> on behalf of participating institutions.

    2. *Deadline for participation*. Consortium-level partnership agreements are made on a calendar year basis. Participating members must be confirmed by November 30 of each year in order that the appropriate consortium discount may be established.

    3. *Changes to participating institutions*. Consortium members may join the Agreement or terminate their participation during the course of the year (according to Section 11, below). In the event that changes to participating members affect the consortium discount (set out in the Fee Schedule), the consortium invoice for the subsequent year will be adjusted. 

    4. *Application of discounts*. Consortium discounts are applied after pro-ration for institutions joining part-way through the year, and after any applicable multi-year discounting.

    5. *Partner lists*. Consortia may be publicly named as a partner of Dryad, alongside consortium members.

    6. *Payment liability*. Each consortium member acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding any arrangement for centralized billing or payment coordination by the consortium, all participating institutions shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of all applicable fees due under the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partnership Agreement</span>. In the event that the consortium or any individual member fails to remit payment when due, Dryad may seek payment of the full outstanding amount from any one or more consortium members, at its sole discretion, until all such amounts have been paid in full.

    7. *Responsibility*. By signing an agreement with Dryad on behalf of a consortium, the Partner asserts and warrants that it possesses the requisite authority to enroll its participating consortium members with Dryad.


6. **Intellectual Property Rights**.

   1. *Dryad Intellectual Property*. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> acknowledges that, as between itself and Dryad, Dryad has all right, title, and interest in and to the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>, including all copyrights, database compilation rights, trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property rights, currently in existence or later developed.

8. **Maintenance of the Dryad Infrastructure and Services**. Dryad shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> and to make it continually available for use by <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span>.

    1. *Termination of Agreement*. The Agreement may be terminated:

       1. At the end of the then-current term by the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> for convenience, provided, that the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> gives at least ninety (90) days’ written notice to Dryad before the end of the then-current term;

       2. By the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> for cause (1) in the event of Dryad’s material breach of these Terms, which breach remains uncured following forty-five (45) days’ notice from the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> to Dryad (or is by its nature incapable of cure) or (2) in the event Dryad provides notice of a material amendment to these Terms pursuant to the provisions of Section 21 hereof, and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> provides notice to Dryad within sixty (60) days of such notice of the Partner’s objection to such an amendment and its intention to terminate; and

       3. By Dryad upon written notice to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>, in the event of: (1) a misrepresentation by <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> in the Agreement; (d) legal sanctions or judgments against the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> in the US or its home country; (3) fraudulent use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> by the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>; (4) the Partner’s failure to pay <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> due; or (5) any other material breach of the Agreement.

    2. *Review of Termination of Agreement by Dryad for Cause*. Except where termination is on account of nonpayment of Fees, the Executive Committee of Dryad’s board shall review and ratify any Dryad decision to permanently terminate the Agreement or any significant partner benefit, within ten (10) days of such decision. Dryad or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> may also petition the Executive Committee to review any Dryad decision temporarily restricting the Partner’s access to or use of the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> for a limited period, and the Executive Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether to conduct such a review. The Executive Committee decision in any such matter is final.

    3. *Effect of Termination of Agreement*. 

       1. An outgoing <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner<span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc"> shall not be entitled to a refund of any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> that have been paid or waiver of any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> that have accrued, except that a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> will be entitled to a refund of any prepaid <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> representing the remaining portion of the then-current term under the Agreement in the event of a termination for cause pursuant to Section 12(a)(ii) above. 

       2. Termination of the Agreement shall have no adverse effect on Dryad’s intellectual property rights. Following termination of the Agreement, an outgoing <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall have no further obligation to deposit <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> within Dryad, and Dryad shall have no further obligation to curate, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span> or assign and register <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> within the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>. 

       3. With respect to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> deposited and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> registered prior to such termination: (i) Dryad shall have the right to keep, maintain, and use such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> and <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> within the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>; and (ii) the obligations of the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> set forth in Section 2(d) of these Terms will survive. 

       4. Upon giving notice of its decision to terminate the Agreement pursuant to 11(a)(i) above, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the outgoing <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> may submit or deposit any new <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> with Dryad provided the Partner has not reached their maximum Data Publication Volume.

       5. With respect to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> in progress in the event of expiration or termination of the Agreement, the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> will be charged the applicable <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charge</span> for the Dataset(s), and a Processing Fee until the Dataset(s) is/are <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Published</span>; payment of such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Fees</span> is due within thirty (30) days of invoice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall such Publication after expiration/termination exceed one calendar year.

       6. Notwithstanding the Datasets in progress, all rights to services available or provided to partners, including any applicable discounts or benefits, shall cease as of the effective date of termination of the Agreement.

    4. *Processing Fee*. The post-termination Processing Fee is billed following the termination of the Partnership Agreement, after the last sponsored <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> is <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Published</span> - which should be no later than 12 months after the end of the Agreement. The Processing Fee is comprised of the following:

       1. For every Dataset <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Published</span> after the end of the Partnership Agreement within the threshold of the Partner’s Data Publication Volume under the Agreement: the difference between the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Unsponsored</span> author fee and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Sponsored</span> <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charge</span> (per Dataset); and

       2. For every Dataset <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Published</span> after the end of the Partnership Agreement beyond the threshold of the Partner’s Data Publication Volume under the Agreement: the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Unsponsored</span> author fee; and 

       3. Plus $450/month until the last <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> is <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Published</span> or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Withdrawn</span>.

    5. *Cancellation Fee*. If a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> receives a discount for a multi-year term and the Agreement is terminated early pursuant to Section 11(a) the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> must pay Dryad a cancellation fee in the amount equivalent to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Annual Fee</span> pursuant to the Fee Schedule minus the discounted amount actually paid by the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner for</span> the year in which the termination occurs.

13. **Enforcement**. Dryad shall take reasonable steps to enforce these Terms, provided that Dryad shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> that is the subject of an intellectual property dispute, but reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or suspend access from, to or through such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or to take any other action it deems appropriate.

14. **Governing Law**. These Terms shall be interpreted, governed and enforced under the laws of North Carolina, USA, without regard to its conflict of law rules. All claims, disputes and actions of any kind arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be settled in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

15. **Disputes**.

    1. *Alternative Dispute Resolution*. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall promptly notify Dryad of any claim, dispute or action, whether against other partners or Dryad, related to these Terms or any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span>. Pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, a single arbitrator reasonably familiar with the data publishing, open infrastructure and internet industries shall settle all claims, disputes or actions of any kind arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms between Dryad and the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    2. *Injunctive Relief*. Notwithstanding Section 15(a), no party shall be prevented from seeking injunctive relief in anticipation, but not in any way in limitation, of arbitration. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> acknowledges that the unauthorized deposit or use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> would cause irreparable harm to Dryad, the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>, and/or other <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span>, that could not be compensated by monetary damages. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> therefore agrees that Dryad may seek injunctive relief to remedy any actual or threatened unauthorized <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submission</span> or use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>.

16. **Disclaimer**. The Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> is made available to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partners</span> and other <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Users</span> on an “AS IS” basis. Except as set forth herein, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Dryad makes no representations or warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, (i) implied warranties of accuracy, quality, performance, compatibility, merchantability, and/or fitness for a particular purpose; (ii) that any such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or other material is free from personally identifiable, sensitive, infringing, errors, illegal data or material, viruses or other harmful components; and (iii) that any such <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or other material not suffer loss, corruption, interruption or destruction.

17. **Mutual Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY PARTNER TO DRYAD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.**

18. **Mutual Indemnification**. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach of this agreement or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the indemnifying party or its agents or employees. Partner also agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Dryad, its officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with any allegation of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights caused by the Partner, including its affiliated researchers or other representatives or affiliates.

19. **Taxes**. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> is responsible for all sales and use taxes imposed, if any, with respect to the services rendered or products provided to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> hereunder, other than taxes based upon or credited against Dryad’s income.

20. **Other terms**.

    1. *Independent Contractors*. These Terms will not create or be deemed to create any agency, partnership, employment relationship, or joint venture between Dryad and any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span>. The <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Partner</span> shall not have any right, power or authority to enter into any agreement on behalf of, or incur any obligation or liability of, or to otherwise bind, Dryad.
