# Institutional partner fees

Academic institutions, independent research organizations, and others partner with Dryad to make our services available to their researchers at a reduced rate. They trust us to provide individualized support to authors, and to curate, publish, and preserve data in the most economical way.

Our institution and research partners also benefit from:

* Time-saving support, training, and outreach — to researchers, colleagues and stakeholders
* Convenient annual billing
* Administrative dashboard — for dataset monitoring and reporting both before and after publication
* Branded instance
* Integration with institutional repositories and integrated library systems (ILS)

The annual partner fee is calculated as a total of the anticipated Data Publication Charge (DPC) for the coming year, plus the Annual Service Fee. DPCs are adjusted to reflect actual usage at year-end.

Estimate your organization’s total fees using our fee calculator, or read on for a detailed fee schedule.

<a href="mailto:partnerships@datadryad.org?subject=Dryad partnership inquiry">Contact us</a> with questions, to discuss partnership, or to confirm the estimated partner fee for your organization.

## Detailed fee schedule

_Effective March 25, 2025_

### Data Publication Charge

The DPC is based on the variable costs of curating, publishing, and preserving one dataset — that is, one package of metadata and data files related to one course of investigation. Pricing is designed to scale with use, with discounts based on volume.

### Annual Service Fee

Partners pay a flat Annual Service Fee to help cover Dryad’s fixed costs for service, infrastructure, and operations. Our fixed expenses include: partner support, training, and outreach; operation, maintenance and development of the Dryad platform; financial and legal administration; and leadership, oversight, and strategy development. As a global virtual organization, Dryad does not operate a physical office. Consult our [annual reports](https://github.com/datadryad/governance/tree/main/annual-reports) for details on Dryad expenses.

The annual fee for institutions is based on annual research expenditure.

To promote transparency and equity among our partners Dryad does not offer individual discounts. However, to support growth and development, especially of new data-sharing programs, we offer tiered pricing for three-year agreements, as follows. Three-year agreements are exempt from annual inflationary increases.
