# Institutional partner fees

_Effective March 25, 2025_

Academic institutions, independent research organizations, and others partner with Dryad to make our services available to their researchers at a reduced rate. They trust us to provide individualized support to authors, and to curate, publish, and preserve data in the most economical way.

Our institution and research partners also benefit from:

* Time-saving support, training, and outreach — to researchers, colleagues and stakeholders
* Convenient annual billing
* Administrative dashboard — for dataset monitoring and reporting both before and after publication
* Branded instance
* Integration with institutional repositories and integrated library systems (ILS)

The annual partner fee is calculated as a total of the anticipated [Data Publishing Charge (DPC)](#data-publication-charge) for the coming year, plus the [Annual Service Fee](#annual-service-fee). DPCs are adjusted to reflect actual usage at year-end.

Estimate your organization’s total fees using our fee calculator, or read on for a detailed fee schedule.

<a href="mailto:partnerships@datadryad.org?subject=Dryad partnership inquiry">Contact us</a> with questions, to discuss partnership, or to confirm the estimated partner fee for your organization.

## Data Publishing Charge

The DPC is based on the variable costs of curating, publishing, and preserving one dataset — that is, one package of metadata and data files related to one course of investigation. Pricing is designed to scale with use, with discounts based on volume.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="table-wrapper" role="region" tabindex="0" style="margin: 0 auto">
  <table style="width: 100%;">
    <caption>
      All fees are listed in USD

Datasets larger than 10GB are billed individually as follows. Institutional partners may opt to cover large data fees or assign them to the author.

  </table>

## Annual Service Fee

Partners pay a flat Annual Service Fee to help cover Dryad’s fixed costs for service, infrastructure, and operations. Our fixed expenses include: partner support, training, and outreach; operation, maintenance and development of the Dryad platform; financial and legal administration; and leadership, oversight, and strategy development. As a global virtual organization, Dryad does not operate a physical office. Consult our [annual reports](https://github.com/datadryad/governance/tree/main/annual-reports) for details on Dryad expenses.

The annual fee for institutions is based on annual research expenditure.

</div>
</div>

For campus-based publishers where both the library and the press are Dryad partners, we levy a single Annual Service Fee paid by the institution based on research expenditure. Each entity is responsible for the Data Publishing Charges for their respective authors.

To promote transparency and equity among our partners Dryad does not offer individual discounts. However, to support growth and development, especially of new data-sharing programs, we offer tiered pricing for three-year agreements, as follows. Three-year agreements are exempt from annual inflationary increases.

### Consortium offers

Our consortial fee structures reflect the reduction in administrative burden and recruitment benefit that consortia can provide. Annual Service Fees are discounted to reflect that savings and benefit, and scale with the number of participating institutions.


<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="table-wrapper" role="region" tabindex="0" style="margin: 0 auto">

      <tr><td>2</td><td>$10,000</td><td>$9,000</td><td>$8,500</td><td>$8,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>$20,000</td><td>$18,000</td><td>$17,000</td><td>$16,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td>$30,000</td><td>$27,000</td><td>$25,500</td><td>$24,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>$40,000</td><td>$36,000</td><td>$34,000</td><td>$32,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$45,000</td><td>$42,500</td><td>$40,000</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

Discounts are dependent on centralized billing arranged by the consortium. Separate Data Publication Charges and Large Data Fees (optional) apply, and are also billed to the consortium.

Consortium discounts are applied after pro-ration for institutions joining part-way through the year, and after any applicable multi-year discounting.

Colleagues interested in a consortium-level partnership are invited to please contact partnerships@datadryad.org


## Total fees

The DPC and Annual Service Fee are combined to calculate the total annual fee, which can range from $5,000 to $108,250 USD depending on the institution’s data publications and annual research expenditure.
