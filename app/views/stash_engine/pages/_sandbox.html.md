# Dryad Sandbox accounts

Dryad uses an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) integration to connect and create accounts on Dryad. However, your existing ORCID iD will not work for the Dryad Sandbox.

To use the Dryad Sandbox, you must create one or more equivalent ORCID Sandbox iDs. Unlike a real ORCID iD, which is meant to uniquely identify an individual researcher,  ORCID Sandbox iDs are test accounts only. You may create as many as you would like, and can use them to have multiple login accounts to the Dryad Sandbox system, in order to view content with different permissions.


## Logging into the Dryad Sandbox

1. Visit the [Dryad Sandbox login page](/stash/sessions/choose_login)
2. Click <span class="t-login__buttonlink" disabled style="background-color: white;"><i class="fab fa-orcid" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size: 1.8rem"></i> Login or create your ORCID iD</span>
3. You will be redirected to a login screen where the URL begins with sandbox.orcid.org and the screen has a yellow warning bar at the top:  
<div class="callout warn" style="background-color:#f5c120; font-size: .98rem;">
  <p>Warning! sandbox.orcid.org is a test website. <b>orcid.org</b> is the official website. Sandbox only sends email messages to <b>mailinator.com</b> email addresses, see Sandbox FAQ for <b>more information</b></p>
</div>
<li>If you do not yet have an ORCID Sandbox iD, or would like a new one, Click "<span style="color: #085c77;font-size: .98rem;">Register now</span>" and go through the steps. Save your ORCID Sandbox iD and password, as it is reusable whenever you wish to use the Dryad Sandbox</li>
<li>Once you complete the ORCID Sandbox iD creation, you will automatically login to the Dryad Sandbox</li>
