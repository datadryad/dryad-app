<h1>Data publishing ethics</h1>

<p>
  Dryad follows community best practices on data publishing ethics and aligns
  with the recommendations and workflows published by the
  <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5391293" target="_blank">FORCE11 & COPE Research Data Publishing Ethics WG</a><sup>*</sup>.
</p>

<p>
  Dryad will follow up on any ethical concerns about submitted or published
  datasets, per due process outlined in the FORCE11 & COPE Working Group recommendations.
</p>

<p>
  Datasets are independent publications and authorship lists at Dryad should
  reflect the contributions to the data deposited for publication. Communication about any disputes
  or conflicts over authorship during or after the publication process will be handled through the
  corresponding author. Any changes to authorship identified after publication may be addressed by
  an update to the data record. If a resolution cannot be reached among the authors, the issue may
  be referred to the authorsâ€™ institution(s).

</p>

<p>
  Dryad follows the legal framework and obligations in the United States. Dryad may have a legal 
  obligation to inform the authorities in its own jurisdiction if a legal breach is identified, but no obligation to 
  notify authorities in other jurisdictions.
</p>

<p>
  See the Dryad <a href="/stash/terms#publication">Terms of Service, Publication Policies section</a> for further 
  information about our time-limited embargoes and delayed publication.
</p>

<p>
  Dryad reserves the right to post a public notification on the
  dataset if it deems it necessary to alert readers about ethical concerns that may impact potential
  uses of the dataset.
</p>

<p>
  In any data publishing ethics concern that arises, Dryad
  reserves the right to remove published datasets if it deems that a breach in its
  <a href="/stash/terms">terms of service</a> or in ethical or legal publishing practice has taken place,
  or if it deems it necessary to restrict or remove access while the concerns are the subject of follow up.
  In the context of any data publishing concerns, Dryad may contact
  other parties that host content associated with the dataset (e.g. a journal article) and may contact
  the institution(s) of relevant authors if required.
