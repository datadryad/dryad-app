## Background

Dryad is a non-profit organization that makes it easy and affordable to curate, preserve, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publish</span>, and reuse <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Research Data</span>; and to meet your organization’s needs for the public release of data and fulfilling funder mandates. Our vision is that the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. To that end, Dryad:

* enhances research by making data openly available and reusable;

* enables <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> to be widely indexed and discoverable;

* assigns and registers <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span> that point to or give context to <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> on the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span>;

* tracks the usage of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>, and promotes data citation and reuse as a metric of scholarly credit;

* makes data both accessible today and preserved for use in the future;

* respects and protects the privacy of its users; and

* generally, meets the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy data curation and publication service.

All of the above functions and offerings, including associated systems, hardware, software, and know-how, are referred to in these Terms as the “<span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dryad Infrastructure and Services</span>.”

   2. *Copyright*. To the extent possible under law, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submitters</span> have waived all copyright and related intellectual property rights that would restrict use of the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submitted</span> <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>.

   3. *Prohibited Usage*. End Users may not use the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>:

5. **Intellectual Property Rights**.

   1. *Dryad Intellectual Property*. End Users acknowledge that, as between itself and Dryad, Dryad has all right, title, and interest in and to the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>, including all copyrights, database compilation rights, trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property rights, currently in existence or later developed. End Users shall not delete or modify any of Dryad’s logos or notice of intellectual property rights on documents, online text or interfaces made available by Dryad. Dryad owns the service marks Dryad, Dryad Digital Repository, and the Dryad logos appearing on the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span>.

   2. *Permitted Uses of Dryad Intellectual Property*. End Users are welcome to use screenshots, the Dryad name and other Dryad trademarks (such as the Dryad logo) for informational purposes only. Content other than <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> on the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span> and blog is available for reuse with attribution under a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license.

   3. *Prohibited Uses of Dryad Intellectual Property*. End Users may not use trademarks associated with Dryad (including, without limitation, the Dryad logo) to imply an association or endorsement by Dryad without prior written consent.

6. **Maintenance of the Dryad Infrastructure and Services**. Dryad shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span> and to make it continually available for use by End Users, with limited interruptions.

7. **Term.** These Terms shall remain in effect until and unless superseded by updated Terms of Submission and Use posted on the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Website</span>.

8. **Termination**. Dryad reserves the right to suspend use by any End User if that party engages in, or is suspected of engaging in, Prohibited Usage as set forth in Sections 4(c) and 5(c).

    Dryad has tax-exempt status with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and reserves the right to modify or terminate any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Publication</span> arrangement subject to a <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Data Publishing Charge</span> if it is advised by the IRS or legal counsel that continuation would jeopardize the exempt status of Dryad; provided that in the event of such termination, Dryad would provide the Submitter with as much notice as reasonably practicable and a pro-rata refund.

9. **Enforcement**. Dryad shall take reasonable steps to enforce these Terms, provided that Dryad shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> that is the subject of an intellectual property dispute, but reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or suspend access from, to or through such Dataset or to take any other action it deems appropriate.

10. **Governing Law**. These Terms shall be interpreted, governed and enforced under the laws of North Carolina, USA, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

    1. *Alternative Dispute Resolution*. End Users shall promptly notify Dryad of any claim, dispute or action related to these Terms or any <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Dataset</span> or <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Identifiers</span>. Pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, a single arbitrator reasonably familiar with the data publishing, open infrastructure and internet industries shall settle all claims, disputes or actions of any kind arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms between Dryad and the End User. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    2. *Injunctive Relief*. Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no party shall be prevented from seeking injunctive relief in anticipation, but not in any way in limitation, of arbitration. The End User acknowledges that the unauthorized deposit or use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span> would cause irreparable harm to Dryad, the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure and Services</span>, and/or other users of the Dryad <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Infrastructure or Services</span>, that could not be compensated by monetary damages. The End User therefore agrees that Dryad may seek injunctive relief to remedy any actual or threatened unauthorized deposit or use of <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Datasets</span>.

13. **Mutual Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE PARTNER ENTITY UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OR $100,000, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.**

14. **Mutual Indemnification**. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach of this agreement or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the indemnifying party or its agents or employees.

15. **Taxes**. The End User is responsible for all sales and use taxes imposed, if any, with respect to the services rendered or products provided to the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submitter</span> hereunder, other than taxes based upon or credited against Dryad’s income.

16. **Compliance**. Each of the <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">Submitter</span>, <span role="emphasis" aria-describedby="term-desc">User</span> and Dryad shall perform under this Agreement in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations of any jurisdiction which is or may be applicable to its business and activities, including anti-corruption, copyright, privacy, and data protection laws, rules, and regulations.
