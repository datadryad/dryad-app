## Background

Dryad is a non-profit organization that makes it easy and affordable to curate, preserve, Publish, and reuse Research Data; and to meet your organization’s needs for the public release of data and fulfilling funder mandates. Our vision is that the open availability and routine reuse of all research data enables the acceleration of discovery across domains and the translation of research into benefits for society worldwide. To that end, Dryad:

* enhances research by making data openly available and reusable;

* enables Datasets to be widely indexed and discoverable;

* assigns and registers Identifiers that point to or give context to Datasets on the Dryad Website;

* tracks the usage of Datasets, and promotes data citation and reuse as a metric of scholarly credit;

* makes data both accessible today and preserved for use in the future;

* respects and protects the privacy of its users; and

* generally, meets the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy data curation and publication service.

All of the above functions and offerings, including associated systems, hardware, software, and know-how, are referred to in these Terms as the “Dryad Infrastructure and Services.”

When you Publish your Research Data with Dryad, you join a community of researchers and organizations committed to leading in best practices for open data curation and publishing.

If you would like your funder, institution or publisher to sponsor your Data Publishing Charges, please direct your administrators to our [Website](/join_us) and encourage them to contact us with any questions at <a class="emailr" href="mailto:dev@null" aria-label="Email Dryad partnership team">gro.dayrdatad@spihsrentrap</a>

   3. *Prohibited Usage*. End Users may not use the Dryad Infrastructure and Services:

      1. in any unlawful manner; or

      2. in any manner that would impair Dryad’s services to others or compromise the security or functionality of the Website or the Dryad Infrastructure and Services generally.

End Users acknowledge that, as between itself and Dryad, Dryad has all right, title, and interest in and to the Dryad Infrastructure and Services, including all copyrights, database compilation rights, trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property rights, currently in existence or later developed. End Users shall not delete or modify any of Dryad’s logos or notice of intellectual property rights on documents, online text or interfaces made available by Dryad. Dryad owns the service marks Dryad, Dryad Digital Repository, and the Dryad logos appearing on the Dryad Website.

   Dryad has tax-exempt status with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and reserves the right to modify or terminate any Publication arrangement subject to a Data Publishing Charge if it is advised by the IRS or legal counsel that continuation would jeopardize the exempt status of Dryad; provided that in the event of such termination, Dryad would provide the Submitter with as much notice as reasonably practicable and a pro-rata refund.

9. **Enforcement**. Dryad shall take reasonable steps to enforce these Terms, provided that Dryad shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to any Dataset that is the subject of an intellectual property dispute, but reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or suspend access from, to or through such Dataset or to take any other action it deems appropriate.

10. **Governing Law**. These Terms shall be interpreted, governed and enforced under the laws of North Carolina, USA, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

11. **Disputes**.

    1. *Alternative Dispute Resolution*. End Users shall promptly notify Dryad of any claim, dispute or action related to these Terms or any Dataset or Identifiers. Pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, a single arbitrator reasonably familiar with the data publishing, open infrastructure and internet industries shall settle all claims, disputes or actions of any kind arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms between Dryad and the End User. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    2. *Injunctive Relief*. Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no party shall be prevented from seeking injunctive relief in anticipation, but not in any way in limitation, of arbitration. The End User acknowledges that the unauthorized deposit or use of Datasets would cause irreparable harm to Dryad, the Dryad Infrastructure and Services, and/or other users of the Dryad Infrastructure or Services, that could not be compensated by monetary damages. The End User therefore agrees that Dryad may seek injunctive relief to remedy any actual or threatened unauthorized deposit or use of Datasets.

13. **Mutual Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE PARTNER ENTITY UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OR $100,000, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.**

14. **Mutual Indemnification**. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach of this agreement or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the indemnifying party or its agents or employees.

16. **Compliance**.
