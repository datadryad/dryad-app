<p>Dear <%= @user_name %>,</p>

<p>Your dataset "<%= @resource.title %>" (<%= @resource.identifier_str %>) has been successfully submitted and will soon
  enter the curation process. You should receive an update within five business days. (Large or complex submissions may
  require a longer response time).</p>

<p>Your dataset has been assigned a unique identifier, called a DOI (<%= @resource.identifier_str %>). This DOI may be provided to a journal, but it will not work until your submission has been approved by Dryad curators.</p>

<% shr = @resource.identifier.shares.first.sharing_link %>
<p>For private access prior to publication, you may share your dataset using this temporary link:
  <a href="<%= shr %>"><%= shr %></a>.</p>

<p>To see the status of your dataset, visit your My Datasets page. Under "Submitted" if you click on the "Preview" link for the dataset you
  will have a preview of your data publication, including the permanent dataset citation as well as access to your temporary private URL.</p>
  
<p>If you were asked to agree to payment, you will receive an invoice when your submission is approved.</p>

<p>Should you have any further questions about metadata, embargoing, or DOIs, please contact <a href="mailto:<%= @helpdesk_email %>"><%= @helpdesk_email %></a>.</p>
