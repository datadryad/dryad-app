# The following URL clarifies how gemspecs work vs the normal Gemfiles and that gemspecs generally should be more generous with
# version dependencies if released for public use separately.  Some doesn't apply since our gems are usually just a
# way of dividing our application. We may or may not want to check in Gemfile.lock for our private gems since app-specific
# unlike a public gem/engine that is expected to be used in a variety of outside applications.

# Development dependencies become really somewhat useless or work at cross-purposes in some Ruby/Rails environments
# and you can't really  depend on them to fulfil your dependencies correctly for testing/development environments. See this thread
# where a developer finds them less than useful and very confusing for modern rails environments, yet the maintainers
# don't want to touch the problems, surprises and confusion about development dependencies.
# https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1104

# But in any case, the takeaway here is that it's probably better for us to put these requirements into test/development groups
# using the Gemfile for our private gems and engines so the the gem requirements actually get satisfied correctly on
# travis or on new software installs intended for development or testing because add_development_dependency is weak sauce
# for our uses.
