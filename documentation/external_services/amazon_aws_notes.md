Notes on Amazon AWS
====================

AWS troubleshooting
=====================

If you’re trying to connect to something and get no response, check
the firewall. Identify the machine’s security group, go to EC2
settings for that security group, and ensure they allow the activity
you’re trying.

AWS Client Setup
==================

How to install the AWS client on a local computer. The client is already installed on EC2 when
using the Amazon Linux.

1. Install the AWS command-line tools.
   * On OSX, this is `sudo pip install awscli --ignore-installed six`
   * [Instructions for other OS’s](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html#install-bundle-other-os)
2. Configure the command-line tools
   * First, you need an access key ID and secret generated by the IAM service.
   * `aws configure`
   * enter your ID and secret
   * set the default region to `us-east-1`
   * leave the output format blank
    
# S3 for staged file uploads from the UI

We are moving to a model where staged uploads will be stored on S3 rather than
on EFS (which appears like a local disk to the server).

In order to set this up, each environment that we want to keep separate
will have its own bucket.

For access to these buckets within the UI, we need to configure a few things as shown
below for *each environment* that we need to have separate uploads (probably development, stage and production).

```yaml
  s3:
    region: us-west-2
    bucket: <bucketname>
    key: <key_id>
    secret: <%= Rails.application.credentials[Rails.env.to_sym][:s3_secret] %>
```

We also need to configure some Cross-origin request sharing (CORS) policies
within Amazon S3 in order to allow uploads across domains
with javascript with the EvaporateJS library. We need to expose the eTag for Evaporate to work.

Each domain that needs to communicate with the S3 bucket for uploads
needs to be added to the CORS policy for the bucket under
S3 > *bucketname* > Permissions > Cross-origin resource sharing (toward the
bottom of that page).

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT",
            "POST",
            "DELETE",
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://localhost:3000"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "ETag"
        ],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
    }
]
```

EvaporateJS works by making signing requests against an AJAX URL inside the Rails
application, and so the
[:s3][:secret] is never exposed in any client side code, but only the results
of the signing requests. It is then able
to upload directly to S3 from the user's browser rather than going through
an intermediary server.  It also splits uploads into multiple parts so it
can handle large (> 5GB) uploads which are not supported by single s3 requests.

The library is set up using npm modules and a library called *browserify* since
node 'require' statements do not work in plain Javascript outside of a framework
like React or Angular.

## Updating node and Evaporate js libraries

The evaporate JS library isn't automatically updated and to do updates for it,
do the following.

```bash
cd dryad-app/stash/stash_engine
npm update # if you want to update node package manager
npm run build
```

The `build` task is in `package.json` and runs `browserify` which resolves the
contents and require statements in the `evaporate_init.js` file and compiles all
the javascript into into one file that it outputs to
`app/assets/javascripts/stash_engine/evaporate_bundle.js` where it can be used
in a web page without having to resolve npm dependencies. This gets the Javascript
working inside the Rails asset pipeline without resorting installing WebPack which
I was advised to wait for Rails 6 to configure and install.

Anytime you make changes to `evaporate_init.js` or you update the EvaporateJS
npm libraries you should run `npm run build` again so it recompiles those changes
into one file for inclusion.


Working With S3
=================

Listing bucket contents
`aws s3 ls s3://dryad-upload/`

Copying to a bucket
`aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://dryad-upload`

Copying contents of a bucket
`aws s3 sync s3://mybucket s3://mybucket2`

Working With EC2
==================

Spinning up an EC2 machine
* Use the Amazon Linux unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.
* It’s not necessary to add extra storage beyond the default, you can
  always add extra disks later.
* Tag the instance with a name that matches its purpose.
* Create a new keypair.

Logging into an EC2 machine
* move the keypair to somewhere you can access
* get the public DNS name of the machine from the EC2 console;
  e.g. `ec2-52-90-82-228.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
* `ssh -i myKeypair.pem ec2-user@ec2-52-90-82-228.compute-1.amazonaws.com`

Generating a keypair
* `aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair`

Server permissions and access control with IAM
=================================================
In general, user permissions are set up in IAM, and OpsWorks
automatically applies them to the appropriate servers.

Users can login to servers with a command like:
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/[your-keyfile] someuser@machinename.datadryad.org`

About IAM

* Users belong to groups
* Groups get policies
* Policies contain access control rules
* When accessing the AWS website, IAM users must login via the special
  “IAM console link” on the administrator’s IAM dashboard. Dryad’s login
  link: https://datadryad.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
* Roles are a way for a single user to have multiple sets of
  permissions, sort of like sudo. They can be useful for allowing
  external applications to access a set of resources.
* To register a new user
  * Log in to the AWS website as root (from the main login screen, follow
    the link near the bottom)
  * Go to the IAM section. Create the new user there (make sure it’s in
    the correct region) and give them console permissions and ssh
	permissions and add them to the Developers access group.
  * Then go to the OpsWorks console. From there, you should be able to
    edit users and import new IAM users from the region. The new user
    should then show up and be editable. You can turn on self-management
    of the user there, allowing them to set their own ssh public key.
  * You need to then go to the OpsWorks stack and “run command” with the
    command “configure” to goose the various servers into recognizing the
    new user, but after that, the user should be able to ssh to any of
    our AWS servers.

Monitoring
==========

Monitoring is performed by Amazon CloudWatch. URL-based alarms can be
created and managed through Route 53, but these appear in CloudWatch,
and CloudWatch is required to manage anything that cannot be
represented as a URL.

Most alarms are tied to the DryadAdmin notifications. When a
notification is sent by one of these alarms, it goes to Slack, the
admin email, and developers' phones.

 
Curator PC
==============

Dryad maintains a [virtual PC for curator use](curator_pc.md) on AWS.
