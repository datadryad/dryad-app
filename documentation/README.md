Dryad Documentation
======================


Dryad's basic documentation philosophy includes 4 levels of
visibility:
1. "Very" public documents -- High-level descriptions and information, on the [Main Dryad website](https://datadryad.org)
2. Public documentation -- Technical documents and other details about dryad. Stored in Github, usually within [this directory](https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad-app/tree/master/documentation)
3. Private documentation -- Internal details, for Dryad staff. Stored in [CDL's Confluence](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Stash/Dryad+Developer+Corner)
4. Private working documents -- Documents that are edited frequently. Stored in Dryad's Google Dive.
