V1 Wiki Content
===============

The original version of Dryad (aka "v1") stored technical
documentation and various other documents on a wiki, with the address
http://wiki.datadryad.org

Content from that wiki has been phased out, or transitioned to updated
documentation that lives in various other places.

*Technical documentation* is primarily alongside the Dryad code in
GitHub, at https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad-app/tree/main/documentation, supplemented with
[API documentation](https://datadryad.org/stash/api)

*Documents related to Dryad's governance* can be found in:
- [Governance page](https://datadryad.org/stash/our_governance) on the main Dryad website
- [Dryad's Governance Documents](https://github.com/datadryad/governance/tree/main/) on GitHub

*Documents about data submission and curation* can be found on the
[main Dryad website](https://datadryad.org), primarily under the "Help" menu.

If you are unable to find information that was previously on the wiki, please
[contact our helpdesk](mailto:help@datadryad.org).
