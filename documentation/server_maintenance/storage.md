Dryad file storage
=====================

Dryad stores data files in cloud storage. The primary
storage for Dryad deposits is in an S3 bucket that lives near the production UI servers.


Interactions with storage
===========================

Submissions to the storage system can be started and stopped from the
[GUI Submission Queue page](https://datadryad.org/stash/submission_queue). However,
actions on this page will only affect the single server that you are
attached to, and not all servers in a load-balanced system. (Note
theÂ long_jobs.dryad script will also do this,
also, on the current server). 

Stopping submissions
-----------------------------

To pause submissions, on each server:
```
touch /apps/dryad/apps/ui/releases/hold-submissions.txt
```

This will put any queued submissions into the
`rejected_shutting_down` state on this server, which means they will
not be submitted right now, but you can restart them again afterward.

Restarting submissions from hold or errors
-------------------------------------------

To restart submissions, on each server:
```
rm /apps/dryad/apps/ui/releases/hold-submissions.txt
```

THEN, on one server, in the Rails console:
```
resource_ids =
  StashEngine::RepoQueueState.latest_per_resource.where(state: 'rejected_shutting_down').order(:updated_at).map(&:resource_id)
resource_ids.each do |res_id|
  StashEngine.repository.submit(resource_id: res_id)
end
```

If storage had errors, you can use a similar process, but you must remove any `processing` entries for
the RepoQueueState:
```
resource_ids =
  StashEngine::RepoQueueState.latest_per_resource.where(state: 'errored').order(:updated_at).map(&:resource_id)
resource_ids.each do |res_id|
 repo_queue_id = StashEngine::RepoQueueState.where(state: 'processing', resource_id: res_id).last.id
 StashEngine::RepoQueueState.find(repo_queue_id).destroy
 StashEngine.repository.submit(resource_id: res_id)
end
```

Async download check
----------------------------

This error typically means that the account being used by the Dryad UI
to access storage does not have permisisons for the object being
requested.


Submission status
=================

The submission status checker runs from a daemon on our 01 servers, as something that
can be started manually from a rake task like:
```
RAILS_ENV=<environment> bundle exec rails merritt_status:update
```

However, it will start automatically from systemd startup and
can be managed through it.
