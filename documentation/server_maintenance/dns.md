DNS 
====

Dryad's domain registration is managed by the University of California IT
system, but the actual name servers are part of Dryad's configuration
in Amazon Route 53.


Load balancing
===============

Dryad's production servers are load-balanced to retain high
availability. Information about managing the load-balanced instances
is available in the documentation about [deploying new code](deploying_new_code.md).
