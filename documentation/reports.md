Reporting
==============

Dryad's reports contain a number of dates. For details on the meaning of the
dates, see the [dates technical note](technical_notes/dates.md).

Shopping Cart Report
-----------------------

The "Shopping Cart Report" is a report of how/when we collected
payment for individual datasets. It is primarily used for internal
tracking of payments.

Run it with a command like:
```
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails identifiers:shopping_cart_report YEAR_MONTH=2020-01
```

Fields in the shopping cart report
- DOI
- Created Date
- Curation Start Date
- Size
- Payment Type
- Payment ID
- Institution Name
- Journal Name
- Sponsor Name

To run the report and retrieve the files:
```
# On dryad-prd (in personal account, where the journal-payments repository is checked out)
sudo su - dryad
cd /apps/dryad/apps/ui/current
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake identifiers:shopping_cart_report YEAR_MONTH=2020-11
exit # go back to personal account
cp /apps/dryad/apps/ui/current/shopping* ~/journal-payments/shoppingcart/
cd ~/journal-payments/shoppingcart
git pull
git add <new-file>
git commit -a -m "add reports for 2019-11"
git push origin main

# If it is the end of a quarter, combine the three monthly files into a single quarterly file
```

Deferred payment reports
--------------------------

For journals that have a deferred payment plan, a secondary task generates
PDF reports that can be be sent to the journal sponsors. The secondary task
takes as input a shopping_cart_report. This report may be one of the individual
reports generated above, or it may be a report for a longer timespan (quarter,
year) generated by combining multiple shopping_cart_reports.

Run the deferred payment reports with a command like:
```
# This command must be run on the production server, to access the production database
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails identifiers:deferred_journal_reports SC_REPORT=/tmp/shopping_cart_report_2020-01.csv
```


Dataset Info Report
---------------------

The "Dataset Info Report" is a summary report of the most important
information for individual datasets. It is primarily used to provide a
list of Dryad's contents to external users.

Run it with a command like:
```
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails identifiers:dataset_info_report
```

Fields in the dataset info report
- Dataset DOI
- Article DOI
- Approval Date
- Title
- Size
- Institution Name
- Journal Name


Make Data Count / Counter Report
---------------------------------

The "Make Data Count" report runs automatically from the production
server. It uses a mix of python scripts and rake tasks to gather usage
statistics, send them to DataCite, and record copies in our database.

The main control script is `cron/counter.sh`

See the counter_stats.md for more further notes.


Administrative screen report
-----------------------------

In the Dryad user interface, administrators may export lists of
datasets from the Admin screen. These reports respect the query
selection that is active on the Admin screen, but they include more
fields than are shown in the user interface.

Fields in the admin screen CSV report
- title
- curation status
- author
- DOI
- last modified date
- last modified by
- size
- publication date
- journal name
- views
- downloads
- citations

Curation Stats Reports
----------------------

Curation stats depend on the history of each dataset. Calculating them from
scratch would require touching every dataset in Dryad, so we cache the results
in a database table `stash_engine_curation_stats`, with one row for each
day. These rows can be recalculated if needed (e.g., if we add new stats).

Some of the curation stats start with the word 'new'. This indicates that they
only apply to newly-created datasets, the first time the dataset is
processed. For stats without the word 'new', the stat applies to each version of
the dataset, typically for the purpose of monitoring throughput of the curation
workflow.

Datasets Affiliated with an Institution
---------------------------------------
When talking to institutions, we may want to give them information about datasets with some
connection to their institution.  This takes into account both author affiliations and funding
related to the institution.  It takes a string and returns any that have that as a substring.
This also gives institutions when people didn't autocomplete their ROR correctly.

Run like:

```
bundle exec rails reports:from_text_institution name="Planck" RAILS_ENV=production
```

Put the string you want to detect in the `name` variable.  It shows the matches in `author_affiliations`
and `contributor_affiliations` in the tabular data output.

Authors at an Institution Report (from SQL)
-------------------------------------------

This SQL may be more complicated than it needs to be, but it seems to work.  It gives information about
published and embargoed items with authors at an institution based on the ROR ids you put into the query
(look and replace in two separate places).
It can then be exported from SQL as TSV/CSV or whatever.  There are duplicate rows per dataset if more
than one author is from the institution that contributed to the same dataset.  The views and downloads may
be off if we go to a model where we retrieve them in real-time from DataCite because they come from
multiple sources (like us and Zenodo) and we don't pre-populate them all the time.

It includes published and embargoed (shows the landing page but no downloads) which is why some
publication dates are in the future.

Sorry, IDK why the markdown seems to do it's own thing when indenting, even if I do it preformatted.

Unique Authors from ROR institutions (from SQL)
-----------------------------------------------

This is an example of a query getting unique author last, first and institution names.  This is an example of UCs and Lawrence Berkeley Lab.

There are lots of duplicate authors who seem to be entering their names in slightly different ways or saying they're from different institutions (or spelling them differently).

In order to get a really unique count, it probably needs to be gone through by hand and eliminate seeming duplicates and it still might not be
100% accurate, but would be close.

```
SELECT DISTINCT auths.`author_first_name`, auths.`author_last_name`, affils.`long_name` FROM stash_engine_authors auths
JOIN dcs_affiliations_authors aa
ON auths.id = aa.`author_id`
JOIN `dcs_affiliations` affils
ON aa.`affiliation_id` = affils.`id`
WHERE affils.`ror_id` IN ('https://ror.org/01an7q238', 'https://ror.org/03djjyk45', 'https://ror.org/01ewh7m12', 'https://ror.org/03rafms67', 'https://ror.org/05kbg7k66', 'https://ror.org/02mmp8p21', 'https://ror.org/05rrcem69', 'https://ror.org/05q8kyc69', 'https://ror.org/05ehe8t08', 'https://ror.org/00fyrp007', 'https://ror.org/05t6gpm70', 'https://ror.org/04gyf1771', 'https://ror.org/03fgher32', 'https://ror.org/00cm8nm15', 'https://ror.org/03bfp2076', 'https://ror.org/046rm7j60', 'https://ror.org/05h4zj272', 'https://ror.org/04p5baq95', 'https://ror.org/03b66rp04', 'https://ror.org/04k3jt835', 'https://ror.org/01d88se56', 'https://ror.org/04vq5kb54', 'https://ror.org/00mjfew53', 'https://ror.org/00d9ah105', 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24', 'https://ror.org/03nawhv43', 'https://ror.org/02t274463', 'https://ror.org/03s65by71', 'https://ror.org/0168r3w48', 'https://ror.org/01kbfgm16', 'https://ror.org/04mg3nk07', 'https://ror.org/05ffhwq07', 'https://ror.org/04v7hvq31', 'https://ror.org/01vf2g217', 'https://ror.org/043mz5j54', 'https://ror.org/03hwe2705', 'https://ror.org/01t8svj65', 'https://ror.org/04g7y4303', 'https://ror.org/02jbv0t02')
