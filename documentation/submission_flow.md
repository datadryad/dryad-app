Basic Dryad Submission Flow
=============================

1. Fill in metadata (DataCite)
2. Upload files
    * See [upload flow](technical_notes/upload_flow.md)
    * Upload files directly (get copied to temporary storage until successful submission)
    * Or choose URLs where files are located and can be retrieved by http(s).  They are validated that they exist and a download can start.
      * Also some transformations of Google Drive/Box/Dropbox URLs into the download links
3. Review before submit
    * Missing required data shown
    * Review display
    * Private-for- peer-review can be set
    * Accept license
4. Submission
    * Update metadata with DataCite for the submitted item
    * Submits to the storage system in a background process
    * Package sent contains manifest (for URLs) or zip file with metadata files and data files
      * Mrt-datacite.xml, mrt-dataone-manifest.txt, mrt-embargo.txt, mrt-oaidc.xml, stash-wrapper.xml
5. Notifying of completion
    * A daemon in a rake task runs to check for updates can be
      started like `RAILS_ENV=development rails merritt_status:update` or
      likely will be added to systemd startup scripts on one server.
    * With new updates it updates status for items that have been stored
6. UI finishes actions for successfully submitted dataset
    * Sets download_uri and update_uri if needed
    * Changes state to ‘submitted’
    * Cleans up staged, temporary files for this submission
    * Delivers invitations for co-authors without ORCIDs
    * Updates the total dataset size


Resource States (aka versionStatus)
====================================

The resource state is stored in resource.current_resource_state (StashEngine::ResourceState).
Allowable values:
- in_progress = someone is editing and hasn't submitted this version to storage yet
- processing = processing as a submission right now (or maybe stalled in rare circumstances)
- submitted = submitted successfully
- error = some error occurred while submitting


Curation Status
=====================

Curation status is stored in resource.last_curation_activity (StashEngine::CurationActivity).

Allowable values:
- in_progress = the submitter is still working on the resource
- submitted = the submitter has submitted the resource for curation, but a curator has not picked it up yet
- peer_review = the resource is availble for reviewers to view, but curators will ignore it
- curation = a curator is working on the resource
- action_required = a curator has returned the resource to submitter for revision
- withdrawn = a resource has been removed from public view, either manually by
  the curator or automatically based on the journal's notification of a rejected article
- embargoed = metadata for the resource is published, but data files are not publicly available
- published = the resource is fully available to the public
