Dryad Embedded Submission: Author Experience
============================================

This document describes options for an author’s experience when
interacting with a manuscript system that has “embedded” Dryad
functionality.

The user starts in the manuscript system, on a page that contains a
section like this:

When the user clicks the button “Submit Data to Dryad”, the Dryad
submission process will open. The user will then see metadata that was
pre-populated in their Dryad submission, which the journal sent behind
the scenes. They will be able to modify and expand this metadata.

The user will then proceed to uploading files.

Once files are uploaded, the user will review their dataset details
and accept Dryad’s license terms.

When the submission is completed, the user will be redirected back to
the manuscript system to continue their manuscript submission.
