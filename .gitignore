## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# We hope to avoid lots of extra commits when database schemas change in engines and get propagated into the app schema.rb.
# if this becomes a problem we can un-ignore it.  We think rake db:migrate will just update this file based on the migration history and
# it may not be needed except as a convenience.
