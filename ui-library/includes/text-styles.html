  <em>Joining the Dryad community has helped us build stronger connections with
    researchers on campus, engage more fully in discussions related to the
    management and sharing of research data, and become part of the broader open
    science community. Being able to address the question “How can I share my data?”
    with a top of the line and curation-focused platform not only helps us to
    address an immediate need but allows us to position the library as a source of
    expertise on related issues more generally. Our partnership with Dryad allows
    Lane Medical Library offer exceptional data storage and curation so we can focus
    our resources on education, guidance, and community building.</em>
