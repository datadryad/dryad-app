# Logos for a tenant are kept at app/assets/images/tenants and may be a svg, png or jpg file
# with the name logo_<tenant_id>.<ext> .

# Similarly, the about and help pages may be customized by adding files to app/views/tenants/<tenant_id>/ .
# The files are in Markdown format and named such as _about.html.md and _help.html.md

# This example file may also be copied into your config directory for tests from dryad/dryad-config-example/tenants/localhost.yml .
# You may need to re-copy this file to update to make tests work or possibly run ./symlink_config.sh again from root of application.
# TODO: It would be good to re-examine this and make it individually symlinked or some other thing to avoid staleness from affecting
# tests in confusing and hard to troubleshoot ways.
