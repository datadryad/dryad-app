    The API for the [Dryad](https://datadryad.org) data publication and
    preservation platform.

    In addition to this documentation, please see the [descriptive API documentation](https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad-app/tree/main/documentation/apis),
    particularly the [API Submission Examples](https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad-app/blob/main/documentation/apis/submission.md) which give concrete
    examples of submission through the Dryad API.

    Our [Github documentation directory](https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad-app/tree/main/documentation) will also be expanded further in the future as more
    documentation is created (though not all of it may be relevant to API users).

    Rate limits:
      - Anonymous users of the API are limited to 30 requests per minute, with a lower limit for downloads of data files.
      - Authenticated users of the API are limited to 120 requests per minute.
