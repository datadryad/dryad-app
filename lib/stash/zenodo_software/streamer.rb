      # Based on the last example (www.elastic.co).  However, they suggest using transfer-encoding 'chunked' which is
      # a model that Zenodo doesn't accept. If using chunked with zenodo it returns "file is smaller than expected" error.
      #
      # The only way to really stream this correctly is to set the expected size from the Content-Length header which always
      # seems to be set by S3 and is usually set for most web servers and static files.  However dynamic content from outside
      # web servers may use chunked and not supply a size (0) which means those streaming uploads will fail when going to Zenodo.
      #
      # This takes an argument of the digests types you want returned as an array, see DIGEST_INITIALIZERS for types.  It returns
      # the zenodo response and the hexdigests for the types you specify
