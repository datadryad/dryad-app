# Throttling
# -------------------

# Throttling allows no more than `limit` requests per `period`
# Each throttle takes a block that returns a "discriminator" for the user and type of call.
# Rack-attack counts the requests for each discriminator within the period and manages the
# throttle notifications.
#
# Each throttle is independent, so it is possible for a single request to be counted in multiple
# discriminators.

# Baseline throttle all requests by IP
# But don't return anything for /assets, which are just part of each page and should not be tracked.
# Also, don't throttle AWS presign requests for upload chunks that will be sent to S3 for files
Rack::Attack.throttle('all_requests_by_IP', limit: APP_CONFIG[:rate_limit][:all_requests], period: 1.minute) do |req|
  req.ip unless req.path.start_with?('/assets') || req.path.match(%r{^/stash/[a-z]+_file/presign_upload/\d+})

# File download throttling
# We don't want a user to simply download everything in Dryad. That costs us too much in bandwidth charges!

  "file_download_#{req.ip}" if req.path.start_with?('/stash/downloads/file_stream') ||
                               req.path.match(/api.*files.*download/)
end

# Zip downloads have a much lower limit than other requests,
# since it is expensive to asemble the zip files.
Rack::Attack.throttle('zip_downloads', limit: APP_CONFIG[:rate_limit][:zip_downloads_per_hour], period: 1.hour) do |req|
  "zip_download_#{req.ip}" if req.path.start_with?('/stash/downloads/download_resource') ||

# Registered API users get preferential treatment over anonymous users. Assume API users have
# a valid auth code. If the auth data is bad, it will be caught and blocked by the API controllers.
