  <dc:description>Mammalian esophagus exhibits a remarkable change in epithelial
      structure during the transition from embryo to adult. However, the
      molecular mechanisms of esophageal epithelial development are not well
      understood. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a common model organism for
      vertebrate development and gene function, has not previously been
      characterized as a model system for esophageal epithelial development.
      In this study, we characterized a piece of non-keratinized stratified
      squamous epithelium similar to human esophageal epithelium in the
      upper digestive tract of developing zebrafish. Under the microscope,
      this piece was detectable at 5dpf and became stratified at 7dpf.
      Expression of esophageal epithelial marker genes (Krt5, P63, Sox2
      and Pax9) was detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ
      hybridization. Knockdown of P63, a gene known to be critical for
      esophageal epithelium, disrupted the development of this epithelium.
      With this model system, we found that Pax9 knockdown resulted in loss
      or disorganization of the squamous epithelium, as well as
      down-regulation of the differentiation markers Krt4 and Krt5. In
      summary, we characterized a region of stratified squamous epithelium
      in the zebrafish upper digestive tract which can be used for
      functional studies of candidate genes involved in esophageal epithelial biology.</dc:description>
