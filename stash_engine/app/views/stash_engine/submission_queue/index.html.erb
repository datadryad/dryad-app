<h2>Actions you can take</h2>

<h3>Graceful shutdown of submissions</h3>
<p>
  A graceful shutdown will allow any processing submissions to finish and change enqueued items to a
  <em>rejected_shutting_down</em> state so they do not begin processing.  A graceful shutdown allows all activity to stop before
  a application or system restart and it can be resumed later.
</p>
<p>
  This action adds a <em>hold-submissions.txt</em> file to the file system in the directory above the Rails.root.  You
    will want to monitor the state above before actually shutting down a server and wait for active <em>processing</em> submissions to clear.</p>

<p>
  <%= button_to 'Do a graceful shutdown of submissions', { action: 'graceful_shutdown' }, { method: 'get', id: 'graceful_shutdown' } %>
</p>

<h3>Restart gracefully</h3>
<p>
  This restarts processing submissions on this server again.  It changes the <em>rejected_shutting_down</em> to
  a <em>enqueued</em> state and re-inserts them into the internal processing queue which will begin sending them to the
  storage repository again.  It also removes the hold-submissions.txt file from the file system if it exists.
</p>

<p>
  <%= button_to 'Restart submissions which were shutdown gracefully', { action: 'graceful_start' }, { method: 'get', id: 'graceful_start'} %>
</p>


<h3>Restart submissions not gracefully shut down</h3>
<p>
  This restarts items with the states of <em>enqueued</em> and <em>rejected_shutting_down</em> by inserting them into the internal
  queue for the workers, which likely has nothing in it if the application wasn't shut down gracefully.
</p>

<p>
  If an item is enqueued more than once, it will only be processed once since items already processed by the repository
  are skipped when it is their turn to be processed.  It also removes the hold-submissions.txt file.
</p>

<p>
  <%= button_to 'Restart submissions which were NOT shutdown gracefully', { action: 'ungraceful_start' }, { method: 'get', id: 'ungraceful_start' } %>
