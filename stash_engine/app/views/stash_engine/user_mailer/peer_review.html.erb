<p>Dear <%= @user_name %>,</p>

<p>Your dataset "<%= @resource.title %>" (<%= @resource.identifier_str %>) has been successfully submitted. Your dataset
  will now remain private until your related manuscript has been accepted. At that point we will begin the curation process.
</p>

<% shr = @resource.identifier.shares.first.sharing_link %>
<p>For private access during this review period, you may share your unpublished dataset using this temporary link:
  <a href="<%= shr %>"><%= shr %></a>.</p>

<p>Your dataset has been assigned a unique identifier, called a DOI (<%= @resource.identifier_str %>). This DOI may be provided to your journal, but it will not work until your submission has been approved by Dryad curators.</p>

<p>To see the status of your dataset, visit your My Datasets page. Under "Submitted" if you click on the dataset you will
  have a preview of your data publication, including the permanent dataset citation as well as access to your temporary private URL. You may update your dataset at any point
  prior to the curation process, utilizing the "Update" option. Please avoid creating multiple Dryad submissions associated with the same manuscript.</p>

<p>If you were asked to agree to payment, you will receive an invoice when your submission is approved.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns, please visit the help page or get in touch with us <a href="mailto:<%= @helpdesk_email %>"><%= @helpdesk_email %></a>.</p>
