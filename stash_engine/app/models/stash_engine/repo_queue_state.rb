    # rejected_shutting_down -- The server is not accepting new submissions since it wants to shut down, but the user need not worry.
    #                           Controlled by the presence of a hold-submissions.txt file in the directory above Rails.root ("../")
    #                           This status can be held and be re-enqueued after the queue has cleared and the server restarts.
