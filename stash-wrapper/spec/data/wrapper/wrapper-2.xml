                  &lt;p&gt; The 2005 HSRC Master Sample was used for SABSSM 2008 and 2012, the SANHANES study in 2012 and SASAS 2007-2010 (adjacent EAs) to obtain an
                  understanding of geographical spread of HIV/AIDS, perceptions and attitudes of people and other health related studies over time.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt; A sample can be defined as a subset containing the characteristics of a larger population. Samples are used in statistical testing when
                  population sizes are too large for the test to include all possible members or observations. A sample should represent the whole population and not
                  reflect bias toward a specific attribute.[1]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the most crucial aspects of sample design in household surveys is its
                  frame. The sampling frame has significant implications on the cost and the quality of any survey, household or otherwise.[2]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The
                  sampling frame .... in a household survey must cover the entire target population. When that frame is used for multiple surveys or multiple rounds of
                  the same survey it is known as a master sample frame or .... master sample.[3]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A master sample is a sample drawn from a population
                  for use on a number of future occasions, so as to avoid ad hoc sampling on each occasion.  Sometimes the master sample is large and subsequent
                  inquiries are based on a sub-sample from it.[4]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The HSRC compiles master samples in order to construct samples for various HSRC
                  research studies.  The 2005 HSRC Master Sample was used for SABSSM 2008 and 2012, SASAS 2007-2010 and the SANHANES study in 2012 to obtain an
                  understanding of geographical spread of HIV/AIDS, perceptions and attitudes of people and other health related studies over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
                  The 2005 HSRC Master Sample was created in the following way:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; South Africa was delineated into EAs according to municipality and
                  province.  Municipal boundaries were obtained from the Municipal Demarcation Board.  An Enumeration area (EA) is the smallest geographical unit (piece
                  of land) into which the country is divided for census or survey enumeration.[5] The concepts and definitions of terms used for Census 2001 comply in
                  most instances with United Nations standards for censuses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A total of 1,000 census enumeration areas (EAs) from the 2001
                  population census were randomly selected using probability proportional to size and stratified by province, locality type and race in urban areas from
                  a database of 80 787 EAs that were mapped using aerial photography to develop an HSRC master sample for selecting households.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The
                  ideal frame would be complete with respect to the target population if all of its members (the universe) are covered by the frame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
                  Ideal characteristics of a master sample:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; The master frame should be as complete, accurate and current as
                  practicable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; A master sample frame for household surveys is typically developed from the most recent census, just as a regular
                  sample frame is.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Because the master frame may be used during an entire intercensal (between census) period, however, it will
                  usually require periodic and regular updating such as every 2-3 years.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; This is in contrast to a regular frame which is more
                  likely to be up-dated on an ad hoc basis and only when a particular survey is being planned[6]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; [1]
